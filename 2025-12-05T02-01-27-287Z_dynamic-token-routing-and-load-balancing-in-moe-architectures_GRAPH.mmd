    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Complete Topic Mismatch
        Requested: MoE Architectures in ML
          Dynamic token routing
          Load balancing
        Dataset Content: Neuroscience/Biology
          Thalamocortical systems
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Gene regulatory networks
          Theories of consciousness
      Evidence from 30 Iterations
        All 50 data artifacts examined
        Zero overlap with ML/MoE terms
        Consistent reporting across sources
    Secondary Finding: Misleading Metrics
      Relevance Scores (0.6469–0.776)
        Do not reflect topical alignment
        Indicate confidence in irrelevance assessment
        Possibly measure retrieval confidence
    Implications
      Information Gap
        No data on routing mechanisms
        No data on load balancing techniques
      Search Ineffectiveness
        Multiple query attempts failed
        Includes "sparse mixture of experts"
      Need for Alternative Data Sources
