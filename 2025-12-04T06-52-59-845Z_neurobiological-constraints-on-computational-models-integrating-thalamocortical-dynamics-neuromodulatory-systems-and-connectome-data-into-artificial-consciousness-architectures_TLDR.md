# Executive Summary: Neurobiological constraints on computational models: integrating thalamocortical dynamics, neuromodulatory systems, and connectome data into artificial consciousness architectures

This research synthesizes neurobiological constraints for developing artificial consciousness architectures, centering on thalamocortical dynamics and neuromodulatory systems. Key insights indicate that consciousness arises not from static cortical circuits but from reciprocal, resonant thalamocortical loops, which regulate both the state (e.g., wakefulness) and content (e.g., perceptual constancy) of experience. Neuromodulators like acetylcholine and dopamine are essential for dynamically reconfiguring these networks, enabling flexible transitions between global brain states and regulating synaptic plasticity for learning.

Important details reveal specific mechanisms: the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) acts as a key gatekeeper, with neuromodulators controlling its activity to filter sensory input and generate oscillations (e.g., gamma, spindles) critical for information processing. Computational models demonstrate that integrating detailed thalamoreticular microcircuitry with neuromodulatory control can reproduce physiological phenomena and enhance artificial network flexibility. Furthermore, connectome data combined with dynamical systems models can identify phase transitions and critical dynamics relevant to different conscious states.

Significant gaps remain due to "selective biomimicry" in current models, which often decouple multiscale interactions like neuromodulator diffusion and metabolic activity. Next steps require developing integrated architectures that couple these biological constraints—simulating thalamocortical oscillations, neuromodulatory state control, and connectome-informed dynamics—to move beyond simplified cortical networks and toward biologically plausible, flexible artificial consciousness systems.
