  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Complete Topical Mismatch
        All artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
          Thalamocortical systems
          Neuropeptide receptors
          Consciousness theories
          Gene regulatory networks
        Zero technical content on requested topic
          No decentralized systems
          No reputation mechanisms
          No cryptography
      Evidence: Explicit Absence Statements
        Key technical terms missing
          Sybil-resistance
          Proof-of-personhood
          Social graph analysis
          Decentralized reputation
          Zero-knowledge proofs
        Artifacts self-assess as irrelevant
    Secondary Finding: Scoring Anomaly
      Relevance scores misleading
        Range: 0.64-0.77
        No correlation with topical alignment
      Possible causes
        Semantic similarity in abstract concepts
        Retrieval system artifacts
        Network/system theory parallels
    Consistent Pattern Across Iterations
      Unanimous irrelevance (8/8 iterations)
      Dataset size consistency
        40-50 artifacts per iteration
      Biological focus persistence
        Neuroscience dominance
        Developmental biology themes
    Implications
      Research methodology
        Need for better retrieval filters
        Importance of content validation
      Domain boundaries
        Clear separation: biological vs. technical systems
        No interdisciplinary overlap found
