This research synthesizes key findings on the neurobiological and computational foundations of consciousness. A central insight is the persistent gap between operational definitions and a complete theoretical model: while consciousness is defined through measurable correlates analogous to observability criteria in dynamic systems, a mathematical model for its subjective, phenomenal aspect remains elusive. The thalamocortical system is identified as the central neurobiological substrate, operating via reciprocal, resonant loops where the thalamus acts as a critical relay and integrator. Additionally, four primary neuromodulatory systems—acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin—are critical for regulating global brain states and enabling flexible transitions between distinct computational and behavioral modes.

Important details reveal conserved evolutionary architectures and specific regulatory mechanisms. Core circuit motifs, like the habenular-interpeduncular pathway, and basic neural architectures are conserved across vertebrates, while fine structural details and connectivity patterns show species-specific divergence. Neuromodulators regulate the fixed structural connectome, with systems like the locus coeruleus serving as a conserved, vertebrate-specific regulatory hub. Furthermore, gene regulatory networks determine neuromodulatory cell identity, and neuropeptide receptor expression shows conserved patterns with species-specific variations. In AI research, functionalism is the dominant philosophical framework, but current consciousness tests (e.g., ACT, Maze Test) risk conflating behavioral proxies with genuine sentience, as they measure cognitive capabilities rather than subjective experience.

Significant gaps include the lack of a formal theory for subjectivity and the challenge of validating phenomenal experience in artificial systems. Current theories primarily model the complexity, not the quality, of consciousness. Next steps should focus on developing mathematical frameworks for phenomenality, refining tests to distinguish cognitive function from sentience, and leveraging comparative evolutionary studies of conserved circuits to elucidate the necessary and sufficient conditions for conscious states. Bridging these conceptual and empirical divides is essential for advancing both neuroscience and artificial consciousness.
