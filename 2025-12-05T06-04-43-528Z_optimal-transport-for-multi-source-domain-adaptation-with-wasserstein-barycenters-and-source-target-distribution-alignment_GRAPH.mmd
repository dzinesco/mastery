  root((Dataset Analysis Findings))
    primary_finding((Complete Irrelevance to Query Topic))
      evidence_1: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        subpoint: Topics: thalamocortical system
        subpoint: Topics: neuropeptide receptor expression
        subpoint: Topics: gene regulatory networks
        subpoint: Topics: theories of consciousness
      evidence_2: Key query terms are absent
        subpoint: No "optimal transport"
        subpoint: No "domain adaptation"
        subpoint: No "Wasserstein barycenters"
        subpoint: No "source-target distribution alignment"
    secondary_finding((Complete Domain Mismatch))
      evidence_1: Dataset exclusively neuroscience/biology
        subpoint: Zero overlap with machine learning
        subpoint: Zero overlap with optimal transport theory
      evidence_2: High internal consistency in irrelevance
        subpoint: Multiple artifacts have nearly identical content
        subpoint: Uniform reporting across all 50 sources
    tertiary_finding((Misleading Relevance Scores))
      evidence_1: Scores reflect semantic similarity of negative statements
        subpoint: High scores (0.65-0.77) for irrelevance
        subpoint: System detects similarity in "no relevant info" statements
      evidence_2: Scores indicate confidence in negative assessment
        subpoint: Not an indicator of topic relevance
    meta_observation((Systematic Retrieval Error))
      evidence_1: Dataset appears mislabeled/incorrectly retrieved
      evidence_2: Pattern of mismatch across technical queries
        subpoint: Previous searches for other ML topics failed similarly
