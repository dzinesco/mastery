  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Dataset Irrelevance
      Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Sub-topics in dataset
          Thalamocortical system
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Gene regulatory networks
          Theories of consciousness
      Evidence: Zero overlap with requested topic
    Key Observation: Absence of Technical Terminology
      Missing ML/Domain Adaptation terms
        "domain adaptation"
        "optimal transport"
        "label noise"
        "distribution shift"
        "adversarial"
        "Wasserstein"
      Evidence: Systematic absence across all sources
    Secondary Finding: Domain Mismatch
      Dataset domain: Neuroscience/Developmental Biology
      Requested domain: Machine Learning
      Evidence: Complete disciplinary disconnect
    Supporting Evidence: Consistent Assessment
      Relevance scores: 0.68-0.78 range
      High agreement across 30 iterations
      Uniform conclusions across all sources
    Implication: Thematic Consistency ≠ Relevance
      Dataset is internally coherent
      But fundamentally misaligned with query
