# Executive Summary: The reception and transformation of the Melchizedek tradition (specifically from Genesis 14, Psalm 110, and 11Q13) in the Christology and eschatology of the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Johannine literature.

This research examines the reception of the Melchizedek tradition in early Christian texts, finding a profound and explicit transformation in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The author synthesizes Genesis 14 and Psalm 110 to construct a central Christological argument: Jesus is the eternal high priest in the order of Melchizedek. This priesthood is presented as superior to and superseding the temporary Levitical system, establishing a theological foundation for a new covenant.

The argument in Hebrews hinges on key typological details. Melchizedek’s lack of genealogy and his reception of tithes from Abraham signify a priesthood of a different, eternal order. Jesus fulfills this type, his priesthood based on “the power of an indestructible life” rather than ancestral lineage. Consequently, this change in priesthood necessitates a change in the law itself, introducing a “better hope” for drawing near to God. The eschatological, heavenly deliverer motif found in the Dead Sea Scrolls (11Q13) likely informed this developed Christology.

A significant limitation is the lack of explicit evidence for a comparable Melchizedek tradition in the Johannine literature within the provided findings, representing a clear gap. Next steps require targeted analysis of Johannine texts to identify potential thematic parallels. Furthermore, a deeper investigation into how 11Q13 specifically influenced the author of Hebrews would enrich our understanding of this tradition’s transformation.
