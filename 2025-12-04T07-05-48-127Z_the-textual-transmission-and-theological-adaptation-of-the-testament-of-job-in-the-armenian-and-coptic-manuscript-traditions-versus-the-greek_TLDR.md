# Executive Summary: The textual transmission and theological adaptation of the Testament of Job in the Armenian and Coptic manuscript traditions versus the Greek.

The Testament of Job, a Jewish pseudepigraphon from the 1st century BCE/CE, was preserved and transmitted exclusively by Christian communities. Its primary manuscript witnesses are Greek (10th–15th centuries), Slavonic (14th–18th centuries), and a fragmentary 5th-century Coptic papyrus, which is the oldest extant version. Notably, no Armenian manuscript tradition for this specific text is attested in the available data, despite Armenia's rich apocryphal collections. The core text is Jewish, but its transmission involved theological adaptation, with identifiable Christian interpolations, such as the Greek term *ἀπροσωπόληπτός* ('impartiality'), introduced by later scribes.

The Coptic witness provides crucial early evidence for the text's circulation in Egyptian Christian contexts. In contrast, the later Greek and Slavonic traditions show more developed redactional layers. This pattern mirrors the transmission of other pseudepigrapha, like the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, where Greek versions often contain more Christian interpolations than other linguistic traditions. The absence of an Armenian version, despite Armenia's active translation of biblical and pseudepigraphical works from Greek, suggests the Testament of Job may not have circulated there or that its manuscripts remain unidentified.

Significant gaps persist, including the need for a comprehensive critical edition of the Coptic fragments and a systematic search for the text within Armenian apocryphal catalogues. The reliance on later Greek manuscripts to reconstruct the original Jewish text is a major limitation, underscoring the importance of the early Coptic evidence. Next steps should prioritize fully publishing and analyzing the Coptic papyrus and conducting targeted searches in Armenian repositories to clarify the text's full transmission history.
