  root((Compassion Fatigue & Empathy Burnout))
    Critical Data Mismatch
      Irrelevant Source Content
        All artifacts describe thalamocortical consciousness
        Zero mentions of key terms (empathy, burnout, clinical)
      Apparent System Error
        High relevance scores for irrelevant data
        Significant redundancy & duplication in artifacts
    Thalamocortical System (from provided data)
      Central Substrate for Consciousness
        Operates via reciprocal, resonant loops
        Thalamus as central relay & integrator
      Specific Thalamic Neuron Types
        Core neurons: regulate conscious content (perceptual constancy)
        Matrix neurons: regulate overall conscious state
      Supporting Mechanisms
        Four Primary Neuromodulatory Systems
          Acetylcholine, Norepinephrine, Serotonin, Dopamine
          Regulate dynamics & state transitions
        Mathematical Modeling
          Applied to understand system dynamics
          No model for subjective quality of consciousness
    Topic: Neural & Psychological Mechanisms
      Neural Mechanisms (Expected)
        Empathy & Compassion Networks
          Anterior cingulate cortex
          Anterior insula
          Prefrontal regulation
        Stress & Fatigue Pathways
          HPA axis dysregulation
          Neuroinflammation
      Psychological Mechanisms (Expected)
        Emotional Regulation
        Cognitive Appraisal
        Self-Other Distinction
      Clinical Populations (Expected)
        Healthcare workers
        Therapists & caregivers
        First responders
