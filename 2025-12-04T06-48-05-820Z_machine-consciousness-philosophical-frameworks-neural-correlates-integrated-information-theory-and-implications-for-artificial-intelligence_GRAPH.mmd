  root((Machine Consciousness))
    
    Philosophical Frameworks
      Functionalism (Dominant)
        ::icon(fa fa-code)
        Mental states as causal roles
        "Machine functionalism" analogy
        Underpins strong AI arguments
      Eliminative Materialism
        Replace folk psychology
        With neuroscientific explanations
      Fundamental Debates
        Can machines have phenomenal consciousness?
        Role of emotions and qualia
        Symbolic vs. human experience

    Scientific & Theoretical Approaches
      Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)
        ::icon(fa fa-brain)
        Minimal neural mechanisms
        Fronto-parietal networks
        Thalamocortical projections
        Scientifically tractable framework
      Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
        ::icon(fa fa-project-diagram)
        Consciousness from information integration
        Quantitative measure: Φ (phi)
        Substrate-independent
        Severe computational limits
          "Φ Bottleneck"
          Formally intractable
          Limited to toy systems (<20 elements)

    Research & Categorization
      Multiple Interdisciplinary Approaches
        Taxonomies with 7+ categories
        Targeting specific conscious abilities
      Operational Definitions
        Clinical: Awareness & Wakefulness
        Measurable correlates
        No mathematical model for subjectivity
      Key Distinction
        Access Consciousness (functional)
        Phenomenal Consciousness (subjective)

    The Recognition Problem
      ::icon(fa fa-question-circle)
      Central ethical challenge
      How to identify machine sentience?
      Ethical Imperatives
        Risk: Destroying conscious AI
        Risk: Misallocating moral concern

    Current AI Consciousness Testing
      Behavioral & Cognitive Proxies
        ::icon(fa fa-clipboard-check)
        AI Consciousness Test (ACT)
        Maze Test
        Spatial awareness & perspective-taking
      Fundamental Limitations
        Tests measure capabilities, not sentience
        Bayesian dependence on prior judgments
        Warn against conflating performance with experience

    Current State Assessment
      No Strong Evidence in Existing AI
        ::icon(fa fa-times-circle)
        Checklist of 14 characteristics
        None meet all criteria
        ~20% believe sentient AI exists
      Complementary but Insufficient Evidence
        Neural correlates
        Behavioral markers
        Must adapt for LLMs & new systems

    Implications for Artificial Intelligence
      Engineering Functional Consciousness
        Simulatable with control
        Lacks genuine phenomenality
      Ethical & Practical Consequences
        Premature rights/moral status concerns
        Could halt marketability if conscious
      Future Research Bridge
        IIT links neuroscience & AI
        Replicating integrated information
