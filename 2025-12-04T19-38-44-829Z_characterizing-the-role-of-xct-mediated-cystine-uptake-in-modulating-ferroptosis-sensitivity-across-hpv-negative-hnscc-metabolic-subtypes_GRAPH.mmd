  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Data Absence
      No relevant data on xCT/cystine/ferroptosis in HNSCC
      Evidence: 50/50 artifacts are off-topic
      Consistent across all 11 search iterations
    Content Domain of Retrieved Data
      Exclusively Neuroscience & Developmental Biology
        Thalamocortical system studies
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks in neural development
        Theories of consciousness
      Zero overlap with requested biomedical domain
    Evidence of Systematic Retrieval Error
      High relevance scores (0.68-0.825) despite irrelevance
      Suggests term matching without domain filtering
      Appears to be a misconfigured data system
    Related Query Patterns Noted
      Similar failed searches on connected topics
        Epigenetic modulation of xCT in HPV+ HNSCC
        Synthetic lethal partners for xCT inhibition
        Targeting xCT-mediated ferroptosis resistance
      All returned identical neuroscience dataset
    Implications for Research Process
      Dataset is fundamentally misaligned
      Requires alternative data sources or systems
      Current retrieval approach is non-productive
