  root((Dataset Analysis: Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Optimal Transport under Label Noise and Distribution Shift))
    Primary Finding: Complete Irrelevance of Dataset
      Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Neuroscience Topics
          Thalamocortical system
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Gene regulatory networks
          Theories of consciousness
        No overlap with machine learning
      Evidence: Key technical terms absent
        Missing Terms
          Domain adaptation
          Optimal transport
          Label noise
          Distribution shift
      Evidence: Uniform irrelevance across all sources
        Relevance scores: 0.685–0.784
        High consensus among artifacts
    Secondary Finding: Dataset Homogeneity
      Thematic consistency in irrelevant domain
      All sources report same conclusion
      Focus exclusively on biological domains
    Implication: Topic Mismatch
      Query: Machine learning domain adaptation
      Dataset: Neuroscience/developmental biology
      No information on requested topic exists
