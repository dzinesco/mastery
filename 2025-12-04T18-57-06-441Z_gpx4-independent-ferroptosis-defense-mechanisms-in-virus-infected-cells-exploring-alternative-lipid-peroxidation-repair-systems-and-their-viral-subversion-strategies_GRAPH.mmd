  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Finding: Complete Topical Irrelevance
      All artifacts discuss neuroscience/developmental biology
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
      Zero mention of requested topic
        No ferroptosis
        No viral infections
        No lipid peroxidation repair systems
        No viral subversion strategies
    Secondary Finding: System Anomalies
      Relevance scoring malfunction
        High scores (0.60-0.83) despite irrelevance
        Scores do not reflect content alignment
      Data inconsistencies
        Duplicate artifacts with varying scores
        Empty artifacts receiving highest scores
    Tertiary Finding: Search/Retrieval Failure
      System returned unrelated content
        Consistent neuroscience focus across all iterations
        No overlap with virology/cell biology
        Suggests misconfiguration or malfunction
