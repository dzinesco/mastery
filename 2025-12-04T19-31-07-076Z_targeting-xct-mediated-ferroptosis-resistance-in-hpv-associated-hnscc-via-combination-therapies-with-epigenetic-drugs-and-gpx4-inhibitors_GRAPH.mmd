  root(Research Findings Analysis)
    Topic: "Targeting xCT-mediated ferroptosis resistance in HPV-associated HNSCC via combination therapies with epigenetic drugs and GPX4 inhibitors"
    
    Iteration 1 Findings
      No relevant data in sources
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts are neuroscience/developmental biology
        No overlap with query topics
          Examples: Thalamocortical system
          Examples: Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Examples: Gene regulatory networks
          Examples: Theories of consciousness
        Absent topics
          Ferroptosis
          Viral infections
          Epigenetic silencing
          HPV
          Head and neck cancer (HNSCC)
          Cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT/SLC7A11)
    
    Iteration 2 Findings
      Sources unrelated to cancer biology/virology/ferroptosis
        Evidence: Multiple artifacts confirm neuroscience-only scope

          b5bf969a-e166-4ff2-bf1d-7911a47d7508
        No oncology or virology content
    
    Overall Conclusion
      Complete absence of relevant data
      Source-domain mismatch
        Query: Cancer biology/Virology/Ferroptosis
        Sources: Neuroscience/Developmental biology
      Both iterations yield identical negative results
