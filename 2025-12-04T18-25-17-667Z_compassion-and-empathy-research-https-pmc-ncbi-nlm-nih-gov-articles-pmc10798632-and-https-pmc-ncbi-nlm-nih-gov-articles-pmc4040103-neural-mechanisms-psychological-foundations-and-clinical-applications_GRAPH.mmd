    %% Core Theoretical Challenge
    1_Consciousness_Subjectivity
      ::icon(fa fa-question-circle)
      Mathematical Model Lacking
        Phenomenal Experience (Qualia)
        Operational Definitions Exist
          Based on Measurable Correlates
          Analogous to Observability in Dynamic Systems
      Available Theories
        Model Complexity, Not Subjective Quality
    
    %% Central Neural System
    2_Thalamocortical_System
      ::icon(fa fa-brain)
      Central Substrate for Consciousness
        State & Content
      Operates via Reciprocal, Resonant Loops
      Thalamus: Central Topological Role
        Relay & Integrator
      Specific Neuron Types
        Core Neurons: Regulate Conscious Content (Perceptual Constancy)
        Matrix Neurons: Regulate Conscious State (Arousal)
    
    %% Key Modulatory Systems
    3_Primary_Neuromodulatory_Systems
      ::icon(fa fa-sliders-h)
      Core Ascending Systems (Brainstem/Midbrain/Basal Forebrain)
        Acetylcholine (ACh)
        Norepinephrine (NE)
        Dopamine (DA)
        Serotonin (5-HT)
      Function
        Regulate Brain-Wide States
        Enable Flexible Behavioral Transitions
        Modulate Synaptic Transmission & Global Activity
        Critical for Sleep-Wake & State Transitions ("Flip-Flop" Switches)
    
    %% Molecular & Genetic Foundations
    4_Gene_Regulatory_Networks_(GRNs)
      ::icon(fa fa-dna)
      Determine Neuromodulatory Cell Identity & Connectivity
        Transcription Factors & Cis-Regulatory Elements
        Govern Gene Expression Levels
      Roles in Evolution & Development (Evo-Devo)
        Central to Morphogenesis
      Model Organism Evidence
        Zebrafish & C. elegans
        ETS Factor Etv4 Regulates Specific Neuron Development/Connectivity
    
    %% Evolutionary & Comparative Anatomy
    5_Evolutionarily_Conserved_Structures
      ::icon(fa fa-project-diagram)
      Habenular Complex
        Phylogenetically Ancient (All Vertebrates)
        Medial (MHb) & Lateral (LHb) Divisions
        Conserved MHb→Interpeduncular Nucleus (IPN) Circuit
      Locus Coeruleus (LC)
        Vertebrate-Specific Noradrenergic Nucleus
        Conserved Core Architecture
        Widespread, Highly Collateralized Projections
      Core Circuit Motifs
        Basic Architectures Conserved Across Vertebrates
        Fine Structural Details Show Species-Specific Divergence
    
    %% Neurochemical Signaling Patterns
    6_Neuropeptide_Receptor_Expression
      ::icon(fa fa-expand-alt)
      Shows Evolutionary Conservation with Variation
        Neuropeptide Y Receptors (NPYRs)
      Pattern
        Conserved Brain Expression Across Vertebrates (Primates, Rodents, Fish)
        Species- & Region-Specific Variations
        e.g., NPY1R: Layer-Specific Cortical Patterns Vary by Region/Species
