  root((Research Synthesis: Data Corpus Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Domain Mismatch
      No relevant data on target topic
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts are exclusive to neuroscience/developmental biology
        Evidence: Zero overlap with virology, lipid metabolism, or ferroptosis
      Dataset Scope is Narrowly Defined
        Core Topics in Corpus
          Thalamocortical systems
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Gene regulatory networks
          Theories of consciousness
        Explicitly Absent Topics
          Ferroptosis & lipid peroxidation
          Viral infection mechanisms
          Mevalonate pathway & isoprenoid biosynthesis
          GPX4 trafficking & selenocysteine
          SREBP, SCAP, ACSL3, cholesterol metabolism
    Secondary Finding: Consistent Negative Evidence
      Iterations show unanimous result
        19/19 analyses reached same conclusion
        Artifact IDs consistently cited (e.g., a6dd8dcb..., a3662e5e...)
      Relevance scores indicate semantic recognition of mismatch
        Scores (0.66-0.80) reflect system understood query but found no content
        Scores correlate with confidence in negative finding, not topic relevance
    Implication: Corpus is Misaligned for Query
      Synthesis cannot be performed
        Required mechanistic data is absent
        No basis for connecting viral subversion to GPX4 dysregulation
      Analysis pivots to characterizing the mismatch
        Documents consistent negative evidence
        Maps the boundary of the available dataset
