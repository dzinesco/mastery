    NPY Receptor Expression Patterns
      Conserved brain-wide expression across vertebrates
        Primates & rodents: NPY1R in cortex with layer/region variation
        Fish (carp, zebrafish): High NPY2R & NPY4R expression
      Species- & region-specific patterns
        Primate amygdala: NPY1R/NPY5R linked to anxiety temperament
        Rodent vs. primate amygdala: Distributions not fully conserved
    
    Transcriptional Regulation & Genomic Organization
      Co-expression of receptor subtypes
        Rat brain: Npy5r always co-expressed with Npy1r
      Shared regulatory elements
        Overlapping gene structures on chromosome
        Primate studies note shared transcriptional control
    
    Conservation vs. Divergence in Signaling
      Conservation in network topology
        C. elegans: Stable neuropeptidergic connectome despite divergence
        Zebrafish vs. mice: Similar hypothalamic neuropeptide profiles
      Divergence in expression
        C. elegans: Divergent neuropeptide/receptor expression
        Zebrafish: Species-specific patterns alongside similarities
    
    Epigenomic & Gene Regulatory Mechanisms
      Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs)
        Determine neuromodulatory cell identity
        Involve transcription factors & cis-regulatory elements
      Evolutionary diversification mechanism
        Zebrafish & C. elegans: Distinct TFs determine neuronal identity
        Underlies conserved/divergent receptor expression patterns
