  root((Dataset Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Topic Irrelevance
      Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Sub-topics in dataset
          Thalamocortical systems
          Neuropeptide receptors
          Gene regulatory networks
          Theories of consciousness
      Evidence: Zero overlap with requested topic
        Absent key terms
          Information design
          Stochastic games
          Strategic experimentation
          Endogenous learning dynamics
          Bayesian persuasion
          Equilibrium selection
    Secondary Finding: Systematic Domain Mismatch
      Dataset domain: Neuroscience/Developmental Biology
      Query domain: Game Theory/Information Economics
      Evidence: High internal consistency in off-topic content
        Relevance scores (0.66-0.76) reflect semantic similarity, not topical relevance
        Multiple query variations yield identical negative results
    Tertiary Finding: Homogeneous Dataset Composition
      All artifacts share same narrow focus
      No variation into economics or game theory
      Evidence: Repeated identical conclusions across iterations
        Previous queries on related topics also failed
          Adversarial belief shaping
          Strategic information bottlenecking
          Multi-agent transformer systems
    Implications
      Potential dataset mislabeling
      Retrieval system may match on negative statements
      Thematic consistency but complete domain divergence
