  root((Melchizedek Tradition<br>Reception & Transformation))
    Primary Sources
      Genesis 14:18-20
        Priest of God Most High
        Blesses Abraham
        Receives tithes
      Psalm 110:4
        "Priest forever"
        "Order of Melchizedek"
      Second Temple Text: 11Q13
        Eschatological deliverer
        Heavenly judge
        Likely background for NT
    Epistle to the Hebrews
      Christological Synthesis
        Links Gen 14 & Ps 110
        Jesus as eternal high priest
        Superior to Levitical priesthood
      Arguments for Superiority
        Melchizedek > Abraham
          Blessed Abraham
          Received tithes
        Thus, Melchizedek > Levi
          Levi "in loins of" Abraham
