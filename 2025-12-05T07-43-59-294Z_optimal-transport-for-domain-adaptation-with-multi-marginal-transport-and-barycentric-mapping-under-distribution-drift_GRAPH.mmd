  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Complete absence of topic-relevant information
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology exclusively
        Evidence: Key technical terms from query are absent
      Consistent irrelevance across all iterations
        Evidence: Uniform conclusion across 30 iterations
        Evidence: Relevance scores (0.58-0.80) confirm mismatch
    Dataset Content Analysis
      Exclusive focus on neuroscience & developmental biology
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
      Zero overlap with machine learning topics
        No optimal transport theory
        No domain adaptation methods
        No multi-marginal transport
        No barycentric mapping
        No distribution drift concepts
    Contextual Patterns
      Systematic domain mismatch
        Evidence: Same dataset returned for unrelated ML queries
        Evidence: Previous failed queries on similar topics
      Potential data retrieval issues
        Evidence: High relevance scores despite irrelevance
        Evidence: Possible scoring based on textual similarity
    Implications
      Dataset misalignment with query intent
      Need for domain-appropriate data sources
      Caution in interpreting relevance scores
