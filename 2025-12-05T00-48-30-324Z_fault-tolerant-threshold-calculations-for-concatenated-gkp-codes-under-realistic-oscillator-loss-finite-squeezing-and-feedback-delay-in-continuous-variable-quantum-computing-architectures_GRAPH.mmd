    Topic: Fault-tolerant thresholds for concatenated GKP codes
      No relevant data in provided dataset
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts are unrelated
        Evidence: No mention of quantum computing terms
    Dataset content exclusively neuroscience/biology
      Focus areas
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness

    Relevance scores are misleading
      Range: ~0.55 to ~0.66
      Artifacts of retrieval process
      Do not indicate topical relevance
    Conclusion
      Complete topical mismatch
      Dataset irrelevant to quantum error correction
      No information on GKP codes, oscillator loss, squeezing, or feedback delay
