  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Complete topical mismatch
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Evidence: Zero overlap with machine learning
      High consensus across iterations
        Relevance scores: 0.703-0.797
        Uniform negative assessment
    Absence of Key Terms
      "domain adaptation"
      "optimal transport"
      "label noise"
      "distribution shift"
      "adversarial" (ML context)
    Dataset Content Analysis
      Exclusive neuroscience focus
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
      Developmental biology themes
        Neural development
        Biological systems
        Gene expression
    Consistency of Evidence
      All 50 sources show same pattern
      Repeated/identical analyses
      Thematically consistent but irrelevant
    Implied System Issue
      Potential retrieval error
      Domain mismatch
      Query/data source disconnect
