    Consistent Evidence Across 11 Iterations
      Multiple artifacts explicitly confirm mismatch
        Artifact IDs: 5051025c..., 82b4cc03..., 470f1194..., etc.
      Repeated statements of exclusive neuroscience focus
      Relevance scores (0.68-0.74) reflect semantic similarity only
    Conclusion
      Dataset is entirely unrelated to the research query
      No data exists in provided sources on the topic
