    Neuroscience Focus
      Central Theme: Consciousness Research
        Primary Substrate: Thalamocortical System
          Thalamus: "central topological role"
          Mechanism: Reciprocal resonant loops
          Structure: Corticothalamocortical systems
      Supporting Biological Context
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Developmental biology
    
    Theoretical Gaps
      Mathematical Modeling Limitations
        Explicit Statement: No theory for subjectivity
        Current Focus: Complexity modeling
        Missing: Mathematical model for phenomenality
    
    Operational Definitions
      Consciousness Measurement
        Approach: Measurable correlates
        Analogy: Dynamic systems observability
        Framework: Measurability criteria
      Acknowledged Limitations
        Cannot capture subjective experience
        Based on observable correlates
