## Executive Summary

# Executive Summary: "Evolutionary transcriptomics of neuromodulatory cell types: linking gene regulatory networks to conserved and species-specific connectivity patterns in vertebrate brains"

This research synthesizes how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) determine the identity of neuromodulatory cell types, revealing a core set of conserved neuronal types and circuits across vertebrates. A foundational architecture, including major systems like dopamine and serotonin, is preserved from fish to mammals. Key structures such as the habenular nuclei and the locus coeruleus represent highly conserved regulatory hubs, indicating that basic neural blueprints for modulating brain-wide states are evolutionarily ancient.

The conservation is orchestrated by GRNs, where transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements control cell fate and connectivity patterns. These networks regulate axon guidance and cell adhesion molecules, establishing both shared features and species-specific variations. For instance, while core circuit motifs are maintained, fine-scale connectivity and some cell types diverge, as seen in the simplified zebrafish dopaminergic system compared to mammals. Transcription factors also maintain neuronal identity into adulthood, with disruptions leading to behavioral deficits.

Significant gaps remain in mapping the complete cis-regulatory grammar for neuromodulatory subtypes and understanding how species-specific connectivity emerges from conserved GRNs. Current models rely heavily on zebrafish and mouse; expanding comparative transcriptomics to more diverse vertebrates is crucial. Next steps involve systematic perturbation of regulatory elements to directly link genetic programs to conserved versus divergent wiring, ultimately explaining how shared developmental rules generate both universal circuits and adaptive specializations.

## Artifacts

### Artifact 1: "Evolutionary transcriptomics of neuromodulatory cell types: linking gene regulatory networks to conserved and species-specific connectivity patterns in vertebrate brains" - Iteration 1

- Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) composed of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements determine neuronal cell type identity, including neuromodulatory phenotypes, across species.
  Evidence: GRNs are defined as molecular regulators that govern gene expression levels, determining cell function and playing central roles in morphogenesis and evolutionary developmental biology. Studies in zebrafish (~65,000 single cells) and C. elegans show that distinct transcription factors can determine neuronal types with similar neurotransmitter identities, demonstrating phenotypic convergence. The cholinergic locus (cha-1/unc-17 operon-like structure) is conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, ensuring co-expression of cholinergic identity genes.

- A core set of neuronal cell types, including major neuromodulatory systems (e.g., dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, glutamatergic), is conserved across vertebrates.
  Evidence: Comparative transcriptomics between zebrafish, lizards, reptiles, and mammals reveals a conserved core set of common neuronal cell types. Zebrafish share all major neurotransmitter systems with mammals. Specific neuromodulatory cell types, like NPY-expressing SST+ cells derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), are observed in zebrafish telencephalon, turtle pallium, songbird DVR, and mouse/human motor cortex.

- Species-specific neuronal cell types and connectivity patterns emerge alongside conserved ones, contributing to functional diversification.
  Evidence: Comparisons between zebrafish and lizards show that some cell types are conserved while others cannot be mapped to putative sister cell types, indicating lineage-specific derivation. The zebrafish cerebellum contains intrinsic cerebellar nuclei absent in mammals that contribute to species-specific connectivity patterns. The zebrafish dopaminergic system is noted as simplified compared to mammals.

- Early brain patterning involves a complex array of regulatory genes expressed in spatially and temporally restricted manners, establishing distinct cellular domains.
  Evidence: In zebrafish, the developing brain is patterned by regulatory genes expressed in restricted patterns at 1-5 days post-fertilization. Subpopulations expressing different transcription factor combinations establish distinct cellular domains, subdividing the brain into transverse and longitudinal regions. Specific factors like foxa2 (serotonergic differentiation) and lhx8 (cholinergic neuron formation) are involved in neuromodulatory subtype specification.

- Large-scale transcriptomic atlases and regulatory element mapping are essential tools for defining the evolutionary conservation and divergence of neuromodulatory systems.
  Evidence: Initiatives like ENCODE produce comprehensive genome-wide maps of transcription factors across diverse cell types. Whole-brain transcriptome analysis in larval zebrafish offers near-full cellular coverage, providing multidimensional landscapes of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators for vertebrate neuron classification. Cis-regulatory element analysis via systematic perturbation is critical for understanding the regulatory grammar underlying cell type identity.

### Artifact 2: "Evolutionary transcriptomics of neuromodulatory cell types: linking gene regulatory networks to conserved and species-specific connectivity patterns in vertebrate brains" - Iteration 2

- Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) composed of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements determine the identity and connectivity of neuromodulatory cell types.
  Evidence: GRNs are defined as molecular regulators governing gene expression levels, determining cell function and playing central roles in morphogenesis and evolutionary developmental biology. Studies in zebrafish and C. elegans show distinct transcription factors determine neuronal identity. The ETS transcription factor Etv4 regulates cell body position, axonal arborization, and dendritic targeting in motor neurons. In serotonergic neurons, the terminal selector transcription factor Pet-1 orchestrates maturation, axon guidance, and terminal field recognition, working with co-activators and repressors to establish neuron-specific features and generate heterogeneity within the cell type.

- Conserved neuromodulatory circuits exist across vertebrate phylogeny, particularly in the habenular nuclei and locus coeruleus.
  Evidence: The habenular nuclei and their connectivity to the interpeduncular nucleus represent a highly conserved circuit across vertebrate phylogeny, maintained from fish to mammals. The medial habenula to IPN projection is described as the 'core' of the fasciculus retroflexus and is conserved in all vertebrate species examined. The locus coeruleus is a vertebrate-specific noradrenergic nucleus with conserved core architecture and widespread, highly collateralized projections across vertebrate phylogeny, described as a 'crucial regulatory hub across various vertebrate species' with similar though not identical appearance across species.

- Transcription factors regulate both conserved and species-specific aspects of neuronal connectivity through control of axon guidance molecules and cell adhesion proteins.
  Evidence: Transcriptomic analysis of dorsal raphe serotonin neuron subtypes shows differential expression of genes involved in specifying neuronal connectivity, including cell adhesion and axon guidance molecules. The ETS transcription factor Etv4 regulates neuronal morphology through regulation of cadherins and semaphorins. Studies reveal that multiple transcription factors control axon guidance in a subset-specific manner, echoing the modular control of neuronal identity where transcription factors act in subset-specific ways to regulate connectivity patterns.

- Four primary neuromodulatory systems (acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin) form conserved ascending systems that regulate brain-wide states across vertebrates.
  Evidence: Multiple sources identify these four molecules as the primary neuromodulatory systems originating in brainstem/midbrain/basal forebrain and projecting broadly to modulate synaptic transmission patterns and brain-wide activity. They are described as essential for regulating transitions between distinct behavioral and brain states, with conserved functions across vertebrate species. These systems employ similar mechanisms, such as the thalamic reticular nucleus and neuromodulators like acetylcholine being critical for regulating thalamocortical dynamics and brain state transitions.

- Transcription factors maintain neuronal identity in adulthood and their disruption has behavioral consequences.
  Evidence: Recent studies in mammalian models demonstrate roles for developmentally important transcription factors in maintaining distinct neuronal subtypes in adulthood. Conditional knockdown of Nurr1 (key for midbrain dopaminergic neurons) results in loss of dopaminergic neurons and impaired motor behavior. Conditional knockout of Pet-1 in serotonergic neurons elevates anxiety behaviors in mice and is required for 5-HT synthesis in the adult brain, highlighting the clinical implications of understanding maintenance of neuronal identity through transcriptional regulation.

### Artifact 3: "Evolutionary transcriptomics of neuromodulatory cell types: linking gene regulatory networks to conserved and species-specific connectivity patterns in vertebrate brains" - Iteration 3

- Core circuit motifs and basic neural architectures are conserved across vertebrate species, while fine structural details and connectivity patterns show species-specific divergence.
  Evidence: Multiple sources describe conserved circuit architectures across diverse species (PMC8916593, Luo Lab PDF, PNAS). The habenular nuclei and their connectivity to the interpeduncular nucleus represent a highly conserved circuit across vertebrate phylogeny (artifact 2d176658). Basic cell types and areal organization are remarkably preserved across mammalian species despite variations in neuron number and density (PNAS). However, evolution of neuronal anatomy shows divergences in fine structural details of sensory anatomy and synaptic connectivity (eLife article).

- Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) composed of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements determine neuronal cell type identity, including neuromodulatory phenotypes, across species.
  Evidence: GRNs are defined as molecular regulators governing gene expression levels, determining cell function and playing central roles in morphogenesis and evolutionary developmental biology (artifacts bcbe8e95 and 6cc01e36). Studies in zebrafish and C. elegans show distinct transcription factors determine neuronal identity. The ETS transcription factor Etv4 regulates habenular neuron identity and connectivity (artifact 6cc01e36).

- The habenular complex represents a phylogenetically ancient and highly conserved diencephalic structure with consistent medial/lateral organization across all vertebrates.
  Evidence: Multiple sources describe the habenula as a 'phylogenetically old brain structure present in all vertebrates' with conserved medial and lateral divisions across species from lampreys to mammals (artifacts d030fc6e and ae828178). The medial habenula to IPN projection is described as the 'core' of the fasciculus retroflexus and is conserved in all vertebrate species examined from fish to mammals (artifact 2d176658).

- Four primary neuromodulatory systems (acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin) form conserved ascending systems regulating brain-wide states across vertebrates.
  Evidence: Multiple sources identify these four molecules as the primary neuromodulatory systems originating in brainstem/midbrain/basal forebrain and projecting broadly to modulate synaptic transmission patterns and brain-wide activity (artifact 76df1207). They are described as essential for regulating transitions between different behavioral states. The locus coeruleus is described as a vertebrate-specific noradrenergic nucleus with conserved core architecture across vertebrate phylogeny (artifact e891cae0).

- Conserved neural dynamics emerge from species-specific developmental programs that provide generative models for circuit organization.
  Evidence: The genome may provide a 'generative model' that is instantiated by each individual's brain, constraining low-level details of neural circuits (Nature article). Preserved neural dynamics across animals performing the same behavior emerge from common organization of neural circuits resulting from species-specific developmental programmes. Different individuals from the same species engaged in the same behaviour generate preserved latent dynamics.

- Convergent evolution produces similar circuit architectures in distantly related species facing similar ecological challenges.
  Evidence: The glomerular organization of insect and vertebrate olfactory systems is likely the result of convergent evolution (PMC8916593). Visual systems provide striking examples of convergent evolution of core circuit motifs. Constrains imposed by different ecologies or lifestyles lead neural architectures to adopt convergent features, as suggested for cephalopod and vertebrate brains (Frontiers article).
