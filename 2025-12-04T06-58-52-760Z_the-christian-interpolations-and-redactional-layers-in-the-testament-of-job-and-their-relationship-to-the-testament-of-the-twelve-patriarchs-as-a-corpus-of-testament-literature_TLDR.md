# Executive Summary: The Christian interpolations and redactional layers in the Testament of Job and their relationship to the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs as a corpus of "Testament Literature."

The Testament of Job and the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs are Jewish pseudepigrapha from the Second Temple period, preserved and transmitted almost exclusively by Christian communities. This shared transmission history resulted in identifiable Christian interpolations within both works. While the Testament of Job is considered a fundamentally Jewish composition with subtle, debated Christian elements, the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs exhibits more extensive and systematic Christian redaction, particularly in its Greek manuscript tradition.

Key details reveal a pattern of adaptation: interpolations often involve specific linguistic markers or theological concepts rather than wholesale rewriting. For instance, in the Testament of Job, the Greek word *ἀπροσωπόληπτός* is flagged as a potential Christian addition. Comparative textual analysis is crucial; the Armenian version of the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs contains fewer Christian interpolations than the Greek, highlighting the redactional layers added during transmission. Both texts belong to the "Testament Literature" genre, featuring ethical exhortations by dying patriarchs, which early Christians readily adapted to connect Old Testament figures to their theology.

A significant methodological gap exists in determining original Jewish provenance versus Christian reception, as these texts survive only in late Christian manuscripts. Current scholarship is shifting toward a default position of investigating Christian context first. Next steps require more detailed textual criticism and comparative analysis across all versions (Greek, Armenian, Slavonic) to better disentangle the Jewish core from Christian editorial layers and understand the varying degrees of redaction across this corpus.
