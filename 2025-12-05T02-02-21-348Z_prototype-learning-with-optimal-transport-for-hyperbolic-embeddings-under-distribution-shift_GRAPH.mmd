  root((Dataset Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Irrelevance
      Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Topics: Thalamocortical system
        Topics: Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Topics: Gene regulatory networks
        Topics: Theories of consciousness
      Evidence: Key ML terms absent
        Terms: Prototype learning
        Terms: Optimal transport
        Terms: Hyperbolic embeddings
        Terms: Distribution shift
        Terms: Contrastive loss
        Terms: Softmax temperature
        Terms: Embedding spaces
    Consistency of Findings
      High agreement across artifacts
        Multiple IDs report same conclusion
        Uniform content pattern
      Relevance scores indicate mismatch
        Scores: 0.52 to 0.78
        Interpretation: Confidence in irrelevance
    Data Quality Observations
      Possible misalignment/error
        Neuroscience content for ML query
        Suggests retrieval/filtering issue
      Topic variation noted
        Some mention contrastive loss variant
        Core irrelevance remains
    Domain Characteristics
      Exclusive neuroscience focus
        No ML/technical content
        Detailed biological discussions
        Evolutionary conservation patterns
      Consciousness theories present
        Thalamocortical resonant loops
        Lack of mathematical models
