  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Contains No Relevant Information
      Evidence: All 50 artifacts are exclusively neuroscience/biology
      Evidence: Key terms (ANN, HNSW, IVF, PQ, LSH) are absent
      Evidence: Previous similar queries returned null results
    Dataset Domain: Neuroscience & Developmental Biology
      Topics: Thalamocortical system development
      Topics: Neuropeptide receptor expression
      Topics: Gene regulatory networks
      Topics: Theories of consciousness
    Supporting Evidence from Analysis
      Low relevance scores (0.674-0.747 range)
      Multiple artifacts explicitly confirm mismatch
      Consensus across independent analyses
    Context: Irrelevance Extends to Related Topics
      No info on embedding vector similarity metrics
      No info on neural network routing algorithms
      Queries on other CS topics also failed
    Conclusion: Complete Domain Mismatch
      Dataset scope is purely biological
      Requested topic is computational/algorithmic
      Zero overlap between domains
