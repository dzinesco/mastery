  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Evidence: Complete absence of algorithmic terms
        ::icon(fa fa-search)
        No mentions of: ANN, HNSW, IVF, PQ, LSH
        No vector indexing concepts
        No approximate nearest neighbor algorithms
      Evidence: Uniform neuroscience focus
        ::icon(fa fa-brain)
        50/50 artifacts discuss neuroscience
        Topics: thalamocortical systems
        Topics: neuropeptide receptors
        Topics: consciousness theories
    Secondary Finding: Systematic Misalignment
      Evidence: High consistency across iterations
        ::icon(fa fa-clipboard-check)
        Multiple artifact IDs referenced repeatedly
        Relevance scores: 0.68-0.82 range
        Unanimous agreement on domain mismatch
      Evidence: Clear domain separation
        ::icon(fa fa-project-diagram)
        Neuroscience vs. Computer Science
        Biological systems vs. Algorithms
        No overlap with information retrieval
    Implications
      Data retrieval error suspected
      Topic filtering issue likely
      Need for dataset realignment
