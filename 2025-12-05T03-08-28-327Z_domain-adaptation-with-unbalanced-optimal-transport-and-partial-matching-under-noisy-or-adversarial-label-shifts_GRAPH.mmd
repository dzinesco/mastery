  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Dataset Irrelevance
      No information on specified ML topic
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Evidence: Explicit statements of irrelevance in artifacts
      Dataset exclusively covers unrelated domains
        Neuroscience topics
          Thalamocortical system
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Gene regulatory networks
          Theories of consciousness
        Developmental biology topics
        Zero overlap with machine learning
    Key Observation: Terminology Mismatch
      Absence of ML technical terms
        "Domain adaptation"
        "Optimal transport" / "Unbalanced optimal transport"
        "Partial matching"
        "Label shifts" (noisy/adversarial)
        Related ML concepts
      Presence of neuroscience terminology
        Repeated across all artifacts
        Consistent disciplinary focus
    Supporting Evidence Patterns
      Multiple artifacts note term absence
        Explicit statements in content
        Consistent reporting across iterations
      High confidence in irrelevance assessment
        Relevance scores: 0.60-0.71 range
        Uniform findings across 30 iterations
    Conclusion: Complete Domain Mismatch
      Dataset: Neuroscience/Developmental Biology
      Query: Machine Learning/Domain Adaptation
      No conceptual or terminological overlap
      Irrelevance confirmed by repeated analysis
