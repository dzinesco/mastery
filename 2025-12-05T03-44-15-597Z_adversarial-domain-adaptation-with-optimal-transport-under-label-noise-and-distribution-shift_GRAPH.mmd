  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Complete topical mismatch
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Evidence: Zero overlap with machine learning
      Key query terms absent
        Domain adaptation
        Optimal transport
        Label noise
        Distribution shift
        Adversarial
        Wasserstein
    Dataset Characteristics
      Thematic consistency
        High internal relevance scores (0.68-0.77)
        Uniform focus across all sources
      Content domain
        Neuroscience
          Thalamocortical systems
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Developmental biology
          Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
    Analysis Insights
      Relevance scores are misleading
        Reflect artifact self-assessment
        Not actual topic alignment
      Systemic domain mismatch
        Homogeneous neuroscience content
        Complete absence of ML concepts
      Unanimous consensus
        All 50 sources agree on irrelevance
        Consistent evidence across iterations
