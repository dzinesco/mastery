# Executive Summary: Neurobiological constraints on computational models: integrating thalamocortical dynamics, neuromodulatory systems, and connectome data into artificial consciousness architectures

This research synthesizes neurobiological constraints for developing artificial consciousness architectures, centering on thalamocortical dynamics and neuromodulatory systems. Key insights indicate that consciousness arises not from static cortical circuits but from reciprocal, resonant thalamocortical loops, which regulate both the state (e.g., wakefulness) and content (e.g., perceptual constancy) of experience. Neuromodulators like acetylcholine and dopamine are essential for dynamically reconfiguring these networks, enabling flexible transitions between global brain states and regulating synaptic plasticity for learning.

Important details reveal specific mechanisms: the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) acts as a key gatekeeper, with neuromodulators controlling its activity to filter sensory input and generate oscillations (e.g., gamma, spindles) critical for information processing. Computational models demonstrate that integrating detailed thalamoreticular microcircuitry with neuromodulatory control can reproduce physiological phenomena and enhance artificial network flexibility. Furthermore, connectome data combined with dynamical systems models can identify phase transitions and critical dynamics relevant to different conscious states.

Significant gaps remain due to "selective biomimicry" in current models, which often decouple multiscale interactions like neuromodulator diffusion and metabolic activity. Next steps require developing integrated architectures that couple these biological constraints—simulating thalamocortical oscillations, neuromodulatory state control, and connectome-informed dynamics—to move beyond simplified cortical networks and toward biologically plausible, flexible artificial consciousness systems.

## Artifacts

### Artifact 1: Neurobiological constraints on computational models: integrating thalamocortical dynamics, neuromodulatory systems, and connectome data into artificial consciousness architectures - Iteration 1

- The thalamocortical system is a central neurobiological substrate for both the state and content of consciousness, operating via reciprocal, resonant loops.
  Evidence: Multiple sources describe the thalamus as playing a 'central topological role' in structures controlling conscious experience. It acts as a relay and integrator within corticothalamocortical loops, with specific thalamic neuron types (core vs. matrix) proposed to differentially regulate conscious content (perceptual constancy) and state (wakefulness, thresholds). Thalamocortical oscillations, particularly in the gamma range, are associated with active cognition and conscious thought, with the thalamus gating sensory input and processing cortical feedback.

- Neuromodulatory systems (e.g., acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine) dynamically reconfigure neural network states, regulate synaptic plasticity, and are crucial for cognitive functions like attention, learning, and decision-making.
  Evidence: Sources describe neuromodulators as signaling chemicals that 'dynamically reconfigure or change activity states of neurons and synapses' to enable millions of network-level possibilities. They are key for autonomous decision-making, regulate the window for spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and are implicated in predictive processing models (e.g., acetylcholine enhancing bottom-up precision, dopamine encoding reward prediction error). Their role has evolved from a global 'state-setting' view to one of sophisticated, region-specific modulation of information processing.

- Integrating thalamocortical dynamics and neuromodulation presents a significant constraint and opportunity for artificial consciousness architectures, moving beyond static cortical models.
  Evidence: Research highlights that thalamic gating can suppress context-irrelevant sensory processing based on corticothalamic feedback, which would 'greatly limit the effects of any cortical NN plasticity' if not incorporated. Furthermore, neuromodulators are described as enabling networks to 'automatically learn novel tasks' by regulating plasticity. This suggests that biologically plausible AI architectures require dynamic, state-dependent gating and plasticity mechanisms orchestrated by simulated thalamocortical and neuromodulatory loops, rather than fixed-parameter neural networks.

- Computational modeling bridges cellular mechanisms of neuromodulation to meso- and macroscale brain dynamics, offering a pathway for bio-inspired AI design.
  Evidence: Papers review how biophysical models of neuromodulation (e.g., incorporating specific receptor effects like 5-HT1A/5-HT2A for serotonin) can link cellular actions to system-level functions like working memory, which follows an inverted-U performance relationship. These 'detailed computational models' provide a principled way to translate neurobiological insights into algorithmic components for AI, such as third-factor (non-local) learning rules that mimic neuromodulatory signals like dopamine.

### Artifact 2: Neurobiological constraints on computational models: integrating thalamocortical dynamics, neuromodulatory systems, and connectome data into artificial consciousness architectures - Iteration 2

- Neuromodulatory systems are critical for regulating global brain states and enabling flexible transitions between distinct computational modes.
  Evidence: Sources describe neuromodulators (acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine) as projecting broadly to modulate the fixed structural connectome, supporting transitions across diverse behavioral modes. They are essential for sleep-wake transitions via 'flip-flop' switch models and control NREMS substates associated with different probabilities of state transitions.

- Neuromodulation acts as a powerful network control mechanism that enables continuous state transitions and increases computational capability in both biological and artificial networks.
  Evidence: Research shows neuromodulators generate multiple context-relevant behaviors through simple multiplicative factors applied to network weights, creating non-overlapping activity hyperchannels in state space. This allows artificial neural networks to become more flexible, compact, and capable.

- The thalamocortical system operates via reciprocal, resonant loops that form a central neurobiological substrate for both the state and content of consciousness.
  Evidence: Multiple sources describe the thalamus as playing a 'central topological role' in structures controlling conscious experience, acting as a relay and integrator within corticothalamocortical loops, with specific thalamic neuron types differentially regulating conscious content.

- Current computational models suffer from 'selective biomimicry,' focusing narrowly on electrical signal transmission while decoupling multiscale coupling effects between neuromodulator diffusion and metabolic activity.
  Evidence: Sources indicate that while models use simplified forms of Hodgkin-Huxley equations to simulate membrane potential dynamics, they fail to capture the complex interactions between neuromodulator diffusion and metabolic activity that occur across multiple scales in biological systems.

- Connectome data combined with dynamical systems models can reveal phase transitions and critical dynamics relevant to different brain states.
  Evidence: Research shows that combining percolation renormalization group (PRG) methods with connectomes and spin models can distinguish working regimes of neural systems, with scaling exponents observed in data strikingly close to those predicted by critical systems, potentially serving as brain state biomarkers.

- Bayesian brain frameworks dominate computational neuroscience but face conceptual challenges regarding their implementation in neural systems.
  Evidence: The Bayesian brain hypothesis represents a dominant paradigm formalizing neural function in terms of probability distributions and prior beliefs, yet sources note 'rhetorical and conceptual slippage' across different implementations and question whether Bayesian inference constitutes the basic operating principle of neural systems.

### Artifact 3: Neurobiological constraints on computational models: integrating thalamocortical dynamics, neuromodulatory systems, and connectome data into artificial consciousness architectures - Iteration 3

- Thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and neuromodulators like acetylcholine are critical for regulating thalamocortical dynamics and brain state transitions.
  Evidence: Acetylcholine induces burst firing in thalamic reticular neurons via M2 muscarinic receptors and potassium conductance activation. TRN stimulation decreases thalamic firing and can induce local slow wave activity. The reticular activating system (RAS) employs multiple neuromodulators (ACh, serotonin, noradrenalin, dopamine, histamine, hypocretin) to control arousal and cortical EEG patterns.

- Computational models of thalamoreticular microcircuitry can reproduce key physiological phenomena and serve as tools for studying brain states and disorders.
  Evidence: A detailed computational model of mouse somatosensory thalamus and TRN with 14,000 neurons and 6 million synapses replicates inhibitory rebound, frequency-selective sensory enhancement, and the waxing/waning of spindle oscillations. The model is openly available for studying thalamoreticular function and dysfunction.

- Thalamocortical oscillations are fundamental to information processing and are state-dependently modulated by neuromodulatory systems.
  Evidence: Oscillatory activity is an emergent property of the thalamocortical system, with rhythms mediated by intrinsic neuronal properties and circuit interactions. Neuromodulators like acetylcholine suppress intrinsic slow oscillations during activated brain states. Thalamocortical rhythms (e.g., alpha, spindles) are modulated by cholinergic and other systems, affecting sensory processing and plasticity.

- The thalamus plays a central role in both the state and contents of consciousness through distinct neuron populations and interactions with cortex.
  Evidence: Thalamic matrix neurons (interacting with deep cortical layers) support wakefulness and perceptual thresholds, while core neurons maintain perceptual content and constancy. Conscious integration, segregation, and continuity may depend on convergent corticothalamic projections, TRN-mediated normalization, and sustained coherent activity.

- Neuromodulatory systems enable flexible transitions between global brain states by dynamically reconfiguring the fixed structural connectome.
  Evidence: Neuromodulators project broadly to modulate the connectome, supporting transitions between behavioral modes (e.g., sleep-wake) via 'flip-flop' switch models. Their activities during activated states suppress slow oscillations that build sleep pressure.
