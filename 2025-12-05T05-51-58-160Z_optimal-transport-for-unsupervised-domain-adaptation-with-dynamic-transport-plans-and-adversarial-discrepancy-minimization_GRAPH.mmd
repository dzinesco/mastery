  root((Dataset Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Topic Irrelevance
      Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Subtopics: Thalamocortical system
        Subtopics: Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Subtopics: Gene regulatory networks
        Subtopics: Theories of consciousness
      Evidence: Zero overlap with machine learning
    Key Observation: Absence of Query Terms
      Missing Terms: Domain adaptation
      Missing Terms: Optimal transport
      Missing Terms: Dynamic transport plans
      Missing Terms: Adversarial discrepancy minimization
      Missing Terms: Label noise & distribution shift
      Missing Terms: Covariate shift & partial matching
      Missing Terms: Manifold regularization
    Consistency Across Iterations
      Uniform conclusion across 30 analyses
      High consensus among artifact IDs
        Example IDs: bbd2ea91..., e6c676a7..., d2887bbc...
      Relevance scores indicate mismatch
        Range: 0.58–0.79
        Scores reflect pattern matching, not content
    Implication: Systematic Data Mismatch
      Potential retrieval error
      Dataset misaligned with query domain
      Biological vs. computational focus
