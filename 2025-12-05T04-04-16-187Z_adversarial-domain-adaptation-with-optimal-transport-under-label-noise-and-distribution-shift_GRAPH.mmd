  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Conclusion
      Complete Dataset Irrelevance
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Evidence: Zero overlap with machine learning topic
      Uniform Finding Across All Iterations
        Evidence: Consistent conclusion in 30 iterations
        Evidence: High consensus (all 50 sources agree)
    Supporting Evidence
      Absence of Key Technical Terms
        "domain adaptation"
        "optimal transport"
        "label noise"
        "distribution shift"
        "adversarial"
        "Wasserstein"
      Dataset Content Analysis
        Exclusive neuroscience focus
          Thalamocortical systems
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Gene regulatory networks
          Theories of consciousness
        No machine learning content
    Anomalous Relevance Scores
      Scores range: 0.68-0.78
      Indicate semantic processing, not topical relevance
      Consistent scores for irrelevance statements
    Dataset Characteristics
      High homogeneity
        All sources similar content
        Uniform off-topic focus
      Complete topic mismatch
        Neuroscience vs. Machine Learning
        Developmental biology vs. Domain adaptation
