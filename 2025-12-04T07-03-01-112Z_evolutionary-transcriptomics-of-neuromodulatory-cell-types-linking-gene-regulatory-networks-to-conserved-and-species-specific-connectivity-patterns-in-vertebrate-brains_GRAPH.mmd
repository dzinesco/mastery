  root(Evolutionary Transcriptomics of Neuromodulatory Cell Types)
    (Linking Gene Regulatory Networks to Connectivity Patterns)
    1 Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) Define Identity & Connectivity
      ::icon(fa fa-dna)
      1.1 Core Molecular Machinery
        TFs & cis-regulatory elements
        Govern gene expression & cell function
        Central to evo-devo & morphogenesis
      1.2 Determine Neuromodulatory Phenotype
        Conserved cholinergic locus (cha-1/unc-17)
        Distinct TFs can yield convergent neurotransmitter identity
        (e.g., zebrafish, C. elegans studies)
      1.3 Regulate Connectivity Patterns
        Control axon guidance & cell adhesion molecules
        (e.g., Etv4 regulates cadherins/semaphorins)
        Subset-specific TF action creates modular control
      1.4 Maintain Adult Identity & Function
        Adult knockout disrupts behavior
        (e.g., Nurr1 in DA neurons, Pet-1 in 5-HT neurons)
    2 Conserved Elements Across Vertebrates
      ::icon(fa fa-dove)
      2.1 Core Set of Neuromodulatory Cell Types
        DA, 5-HT, GABA, Glutamate systems
        (e.g., zebrafish share all major systems with mammals)
        Specific conserved types (e.g., NPY+ SST+ MGE-derived)
      2.2 Ancient Circuit Architectures
        Habenular nuclei → IPN circuit ("core" fasciculus retroflexus)
        Conserved from fish to mammals
        Locus coeruleus: vertebrate-specific, conserved core
      2.3 Four Primary Ascending Systems
        ACh, NE, DA, 5-HT
        Conserved brainstem/midbrain origins & broad projections
        Regulate brain-wide states & behavioral transitions
      2.4 Basic Neural Architectures & Dynamics
        Conserved circuit motifs & areal organization
        Preserved latent dynamics from common circuit organization
        Genome as "generative model" for circuit instantiation
    3 Species-Specific Divergence & Innovation
      ::icon(fa fa-branch)
      3.1 Novel Cell Types & Lineages
        Some cell types lack 1:1 homologs
        (e.g., zebrafish vs. lizard comparisons)
        Lineage-specific derivation occurs
      3.2 Modified Connectivity Patterns
        Zebrafish cerebellum: intrinsic nuclei absent in mammals
        Simplified dopaminergic system (zebrafish vs. mammals)
      3.3 Fine Structural Variation
        Divergence in sensory anatomy & synaptic connectivity
        Variations in neuron number & density
      3.4 Convergent Evolution
        Similar solutions to ecological challenges
        (e.g., olfactory glomeruli in insects/vertebrates)
        Visual system circuit motifs
    4 Methodological & Evidential Foundations
      ::icon(fa fa-microscope)
      4.1 Transcriptomic & Regulatory Mapping
        Large-scale atlases (e.g., ENCODE, zebrafish larval brain)
        Essential for defining conservation/divergence
        Cis-regulatory element analysis via perturbation
      4.2 Early Patterning & Specification
        Complex array of regulatory genes
        Spatiotemporally restricted expression
        (e.g., foxa2 for 5-HT, lhx8 for ACh)
      4.3 Model Systems & Comparative Approaches
        Zebrafish (~65,000 single cells), C. elegans, mammals
        Comparative transcriptomics across vertebrates
        Links developmental programs to evolved circuits
