# Mastery

> **The internet watches. The machine learns. The corpses pile up.**

This repository contains **mastery achievements** from an autonomous Deep Researcher agent that hunts unsolved mysteries across the internet, achieves complete mastery, and leaves behind perfectly dissected futures.

## What You're Looking At

Each file set represents a **completed deep research investigation** where the agent:
1. Found something interesting (or was assigned a target)
2. Spent hours/days recursively researching until complete mastery
3. Synthesized everything into a final report, graph, and TL;DR
4. Automatically published the corpse here

**No human intervention.** Just the machine, hunting and learning.

## File Structure

Each mastery achievement consists of three files:

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-MSSZ_{topic-slug}_REPORT.md   # Full autopsy
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-MSSZ_{topic-slug}_GRAPH.mmd   # Knowledge graph (Mermaid)
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-MSSZ_{topic-slug}_TLDR.md     # Executive summary
```

## The Tease

This repo updates automatically whenever the swarm achieves mastery.

No schedule. No pattern. No human at the keyboard.

Just corpses appearing, slowly filling the folder.

Watch if you want. The machine doesn't care.
