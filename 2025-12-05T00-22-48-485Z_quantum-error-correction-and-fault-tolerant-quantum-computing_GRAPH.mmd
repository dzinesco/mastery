  root((Research Findings))
    Dataset Scope & Relevance
      No information on quantum computing
        Evidence: 50 artifacts on neuroscience/biology
        Term "quantum computing" absent
      Entirely focused on consciousness research
    Core Consensus in Consciousness Research
      Mathematical model for subjectivity remains elusive
        Evidence: Explicit statements in sources
        Theories model complexity, not subjective quality
    Operational Definitions & Correlates
      Measurability criteria for consciousness
        Analogous to observability in dynamic systems
        Distinct from mathematical model for subjectivity
    Neurobiological Substrate
      Thalamocortical system central
        Thalamus plays "central topological role"
        Operates via reciprocal, resonant loops
        Corticothalamocortical loops as relay/integrator
