  root(Consciousness Research Findings)
    (Core Consensus)
      Mathematical model for subjectivity (phenomenality) remains elusive
        Evidence: Explicit statements in multiple sources
        Available theories model complexity, not subjective quality
    (Operational Definition)
      Defined through measurable correlates
        Uses criteria analogous to observability in dynamic systems
        Acknowledges lack of model for subjective experience
    (Neurobiological Substrate)
      Thalamocortical system is central
        Recurring focus in neurological theories
        Key neural system involved (specific details vary)
    (Data Context Note)
      Provided data is unrelated to requested topic
        Topics: mathematical models, measurability, functionalism, thalamocortical system
        Absence of quantum computing terms
