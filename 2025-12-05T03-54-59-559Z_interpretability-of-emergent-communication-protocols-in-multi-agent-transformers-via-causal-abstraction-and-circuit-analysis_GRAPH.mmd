  root((Dataset Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Topic Mismatch
      No relevant information in dataset
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts irrelevant
        Evidence: High relevance scores (0.62-0.78) indicate semantic mismatch
      Query vs. Dataset Domain Conflict
        Query Domain: AI/ML
          ::icon(fa fa-solid fa-microchip)
          Multi-agent transformers
          Emergent communication protocols
          Causal abstraction
          Circuit analysis
        Dataset Domain: Biological Sciences
          ::icon(fa fa-solid fa-dna)
          Neuroscience
            Thalamocortical system
            Neuropeptide receptor expression
            Theories of consciousness
          Developmental Biology
            Gene regulatory networks
    Consistency of Findings
      Uniform irrelevance across all sources
        All 50 artifacts state same conclusion
        Multiple artifact IDs cited (e.g., e60ea14a..., 989c513c...)
      Repeated evidence patterns
        Exclusive focus on biological systems
        Absence of AI/ML technical terms
    Implications
      Possible data retrieval error
        System understood query but lacked relevant content
        Complete domain mismatch suggests filtering/index issue
      Research conclusion
        Dataset cannot inform requested topic
        Need to source AI/ML literature instead
