  root((Research Synthesis: Dataset Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Complete Topic Mismatch
      Dataset contains zero relevant information
      All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
      No overlap with requested technical domain
    Evidence of Irrelevance
      Consistent absence of key technical terms
        ::icon(fa fa-ban)
        Decentralized identity
        Verifiable credentials
        Zero-knowledge proofs
        Selective disclosure
        Cryptographic protocols
      Exclusive focus on biological topics
        ::icon(fa fa-brain)
        Thalamocortical systems
        Neuropeptide receptors
        Consciousness theories
        Gene regulatory networks
    Dataset Characteristics
      High internal consistency
        All artifacts report same finding
        Uniform irrelevance assessment
      Misalignment indicators
        Possibly mislabeled or incorrect source
        References unrelated technical queries
    Relevance Score Analysis
      Scores range 0.65-0.79
      Reflect strength of negative finding
      Not indicative of topical relevance
      Suggests algorithmic textual similarity
    Implications
      Dataset unsuitable for requested synthesis
      Fundamental domain mismatch
      Need for correct technical corpus
