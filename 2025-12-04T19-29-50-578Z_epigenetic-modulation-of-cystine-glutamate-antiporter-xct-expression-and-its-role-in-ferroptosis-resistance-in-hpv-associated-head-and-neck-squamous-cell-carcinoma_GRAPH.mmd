  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    Primary Observation: Dataset-Topic Misalignment
      All 50 data artifacts are from neuroscience/developmental biology
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
      Zero artifacts contain information on the requested topic
        No ferroptosis
        No viral infections (HPV, EBV, KSHV)
        No epigenetic silencing mechanisms
        No head and neck cancer (HNSCC)
        No cystine-glutamate antiporter (xCT/SLC7A11)
    Evidence of Systematic Retrieval Failure
      Relevance scores indicate query recognition but no topical overlap
      Artifacts reference other unrelated viral oncology topics in "no relevant data" statements
        EBV & KSHV mentioned
        GPX4-independent pathways
        Confirms active retrieval from an incorrect corpus
    Consistency Across All Iterations
      Identical finding repeated in all 5 query iterations
      Previous related queries also returned no relevant data
        Epigenetic regulation of glutathione metabolism
        Viral microRNAs & ferroptosis in lymphomas
        Viral hijacking of lipid metabolism
    Conclusion: Irrelevant Dataset
      Dataset is exclusively neuroscience content
      No overlap with cancer biology, virology, or ferroptosis research
      Information on specified topic does not exist in provided sources
