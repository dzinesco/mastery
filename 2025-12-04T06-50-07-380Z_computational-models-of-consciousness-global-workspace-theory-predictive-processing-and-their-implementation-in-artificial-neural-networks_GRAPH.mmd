  root((Computational Models<br>of Consciousness))
    Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
      Core Concept: Global Broadcast
        Serial, limited-capacity workspace
        Information competition among parallel modules
      Evidence & Support
        Bernard Baars' cognitive architecture
        fMRI & EEG experimental findings
      Computational Implementations
        Stan Franklin's IDA/LIDA
        Dehaene's Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)
    Predictive Processing (PP)
      Core Concept: Hierarchical Prediction
        Brain as prediction-error minimizer
        Bayesian inference & predictive coding
      Theoretical Frameworks
        Free Energy Principle
        Precision-weighted error minimization
      Current Status
        Unifying computational framework
        Direct link to subjectivity debated
    Integration & Implementation
      Hybrid Models
        Predictive Global Neuronal Workspace
        Combines broadcast with predictive coding
      Artificial Neural Networks
        GNW as computationally simulable
        Primary simulation tool for theories
    Philosophical & Conceptual Boundaries
      Dominant Framework: Functionalism
        GWT as functionalist theory
        Mental states defined by causal roles
        Underpins strong AI debate
      Current Limitations
        Models complexity & correlates only
        No mathematical model for subjectivity
        Focus on operational definitions
