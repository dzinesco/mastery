  root((Research Analysis))
    Complete Data-Topic Mismatch
      Dataset exclusively neuroscience/developmental biology
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
      Zero overlap with requested domain
        No cancer biology
        No ferroptosis
        No lipid metabolism
    Absence of Relevant Findings
      No lipid peroxidation substrates
      No enzymatic drivers
      No xCT-depleted HNSCC cell data
      No cystine starvation context
      No compensatory antioxidant systems
      No metabolic rewiring evidence
    Consistent Evidence Across Iterations
      All 50 artifacts irrelevant
      Multiple artifact IDs confirm mismatch
      Repeated irrelevance statements
      Domain misalignment explicitly stated
    Implications for Research
      Dataset cannot answer query
      Need for domain-appropriate sources
      Topic remains unexplored in provided data
