## Executive Summary

# Executive Summary: The Greek recensions and Christian interpolations in the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs: textual archaeology to isolate the Jewish core from its later Christian redaction and reuse.

The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs is a complex pseudepigraphical text, preserved primarily in Greek manuscripts from the 10th century onward. Scholarly consensus, established over centuries, identifies it as a fundamentally Jewish work from the Second Temple period that was subsequently and extensively edited by Christian scribes. Its transmission history is typical of such texts, having been predominantly preserved by Christian communities, which embedded their own theological perspectives into the material.

Critical analysis relies on comparing multiple ancient versions—Greek, Armenian, and Slavonic—to detect later additions. The Armenian version, for instance, contains fewer overt Christian interpolations than the Greek. Specific Christian edits include prophecies about Jesus, references to baptism and crucifixion, and direct identifications of Jesus with God. Furthermore, the discovery of related Aramaic fragments among the Dead Sea Scrolls provides external evidence for an earlier, non-apocalyptic Jewish source, aiding the textual archaeology to separate core layers from redaction.

Despite agreement on the presence of Christian interpolations, significant debate continues regarding their precise extent and nature, with many proposed identifications remaining contested. The primary limitation is the lack of complete early manuscripts, requiring reliance on comparative textual criticism. Next steps for research involve deeper synthesis of evidence from the Qumran fragments with the later versions to more precisely reconstruct the hypothesized Jewish core and understand the theological motives behind its Christian reuse.

## Artifacts

### Artifact 1: The Greek recensions and Christian interpolations in the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs: textual archaeology to isolate the Jewish core from its later Christian redaction and reuse. - Iteration 1

- The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs exists in multiple ancient versions, with the Greek manuscripts containing significant Christian interpolations.
  Evidence: The text is known from fifteen Greek manuscripts (oldest complete from 10th century), plus Slavonic and Armenian versions. The Armenian version is noted to contain 'fewer Christian interpolations than the Greek version' (Wikipedia).

- Scholars recognize the work as fundamentally Jewish in origin but heavily redacted by Christian scribes.
  Evidence: Critical analysis since Grabe (1714) concluded 'the basis of the work is Jewish, though there are many Christological interpolations' (Jewish Encyclopedia). Marinus de Jonge states they are 'Christian in their present form' but derived from earlier material (Early Christian Writings).

- Specific Christian interpolations include prophecies about Jesus, baptism, crucifixion, and identifications of Jesus with God.
  Evidence: The Jewish Encyclopedia notes 'many prophetic passages are apparently of Christian origin' foretelling 'incarnation, sanctification by water (baptism), and crucifixion' where 'Jesus is often identified with God.'

- Textual comparison across versions (Greek, Armenian, Slavonic) and with Dead Sea Scroll fragments helps isolate the Jewish core.
  Evidence: Variants between versions assist in detecting interpolations (e.g., a eulogy of Paul in Greek Testament of Benjamin absent from Armenian). Comparison with Aramaic fragments from Qumran (4Q213-214, 1Q21) provides evidence of a 'non-apocalyptic precursor' (Wikipedia, Brill).

- The scholarly debate centers on the extent and nature of Christian interpolations rather than their existence.
  Evidence: CDAMM states scholars have argued 'about the extent and nature of these Christian interpolations' since the 19th century, with identifications 'strongly contested.'

- The transmission history shows Christian preservation of a Jewish pseudepigraphon.
  Evidence: Artifact notes that Jewish pseudepigrapha from the Second Temple period were 'predominantly preserved and transmitted by Christian communities,' with oldest manuscripts often dating from 9th–10th centuries CE.
