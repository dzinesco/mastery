  root((Dataset Analysis))
    Complete Topic Mismatch
      No relevant information in dataset
        All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        No content on neural networks, transformers, or multi-agent systems
        No information on causal abstraction or circuit analysis for AI
      Consistent irrelevance across all sources
        Every artifact (50/50) states same conclusion
        Relevance scores range 0.63-0.81 (low alignment)
        High consensus on topic mismatch
    Dataset Content Focus
      Exclusively biological systems
        Neuroscience topics
          Thalamocortical system
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Theories of consciousness
        Developmental biology topics
          Gene regulatory networks
      No AI/ML technical information
        No transformer architectures
        No multi-agent reinforcement learning
        No interpretability methods for AI
    Potential Systemic Issues
      Data retrieval or filtering error
        Misalignment between query domain and dataset domain
        Possible mislabeled or incorrectly provided dataset
        Search methodology may be flawed
      Artifacts reference related but distinct topics
        Some mention "emergent communication protocols" in different contexts
        All return neuroscience content regardless
