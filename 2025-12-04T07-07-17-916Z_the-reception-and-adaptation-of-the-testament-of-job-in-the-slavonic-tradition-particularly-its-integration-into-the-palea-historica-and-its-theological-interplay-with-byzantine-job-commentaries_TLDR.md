# Executive Summary: The reception and adaptation of the Testament of Job in the Slavonic tradition, particularly its integration into the Palea historica and its theological interplay with Byzantine Job commentaries.

This research examines the reception and adaptation of the Testament of Job within the Slavonic tradition. Key insights reveal that this non-canonical text is preserved in three primary manuscript traditions: Greek, Coptic, and Slavonic, with no evidence of an Armenian version. Originating as a Jewish work from the 1st century BCE or CE, the text later incorporated Christian interpolations during its transmission, reflecting its evolving theological context.

The Slavonic version represents a distinct branch of transmission, having been reconstructed from three specific manuscripts. This places it alongside the older, fragmentary Coptic papyrus (the oldest witness) and several Greek manuscripts as a primary witness to the text. The integration of the Testament of Job into compilations like the *Palea historica* demonstrates its adaptation within Slavonic literary and theological frameworks, where it interacted with Byzantine Job commentaries.

A significant gap is the lack of a detailed comparative analysis of the Slavonic version's text against the Greek and Coptic traditions to precisely map its adaptations and theological emphases. Furthermore, the exact nature and extent of its "theological interplay" with Byzantine commentaries in the *Palea* context requires deeper study. Next steps should involve a close textual and thematic analysis of the Slavonic Testament of Job within its manuscript and compilatory context to clarify its unique role in the tradition.
