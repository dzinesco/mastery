  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Conclusion: Dataset Irrelevance
      No relevant data on specified interplay
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts are neuroscience/developmental biology focused
        Topics covered:
          Thalamocortical system
          Neuropeptide receptor expression
          Gene regulatory networks
          Theories of consciousness
      Complete absence of oncology content
        No artifacts discuss:

          Glutathione metabolism
          Mesenchymal cancer subtypes
    Supporting Evidence
      High-confidence irrelevance assessments
        Relevance scores: 0.725 to 0.764
        Multiple consistent artifacts
          IDs: 0655a44d..., 429baed6..., b34de4d3...
          IDs: 4385fce3..., b34de4d3..., 429baed6...
      Categorical domain mismatch
