  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    primary_finding: Dataset contains no relevant information on MoE routing
      evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss unrelated domains
        subpoint: Topics are exclusively neuroscience & developmental biology
          example: Thalamocortical system
          example: Neuropeptide receptor expression
          example: Gene regulatory networks
          example: Theories of consciousness
        subpoint: No machine learning terminology present
          missing_terms: MoE routing
          missing_terms: Neural networks
          missing_terms: Sparse expert selection
          missing_terms: Gating mechanisms
    secondary_finding: Complete domain mismatch
      evidence: Consistent across all iterations
        subpoint: Multiple artifacts confirm same finding
          artifact_ids: ddf4bd59, bfc4156f, 8ea66835
          artifact_ids: 53ba7107, 5f9c9eaa, 89501de2
          artifact_ids: e9ee5678, e76e4c09, 53028f62
        subpoint: High relevance scores indicate strong agreement
          score_range: 0.62 to 0.79
    implication: Cannot provide requested technical information
      specific_absences: Attention-based dynamic routing
