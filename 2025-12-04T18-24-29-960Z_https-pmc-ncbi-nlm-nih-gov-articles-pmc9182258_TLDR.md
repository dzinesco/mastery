This research synthesizes key findings on the neurobiological and theoretical foundations of consciousness. A central conclusion is that while the thalamocortical system, operating via reciprocal resonant loops, is identified as the primary neurobiological substrate for conscious states and content, a mathematical model for the subjective, phenomenal aspect of consciousness (subjectivity) remains elusive. Current theories primarily model the complexity of consciousness rather than its intrinsic quality of experience. Consequently, the field relies on operational definitions using "measurability criteria" analogous to observability in dynamic systems to study consciousness empirically.

Important details reveal a multi-level framework. Four primary neuromodulatory systems—acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin—originate in subcortical regions and project broadly to regulate global brain states and flexible behavioral transitions. At a molecular level, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) determine the identity and connectivity of these neuromodulatory cells. Furthermore, neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems, such as neuropeptide receptor expression and the locus coeruleus, show evolutionary conservation across vertebrates with species-specific variations, highlighting both shared mechanisms and adaptive specializations in the neural architecture underlying consciousness.

Significant gaps persist, most notably the absence of a formal theory for subjectivity—the "hard problem" of consciousness. Current AI consciousness tests measure behavioral proxies and cognitive capabilities, not genuine sentience, underscoring this theoretical limitation. Future research must bridge this divide by developing mathematical frameworks for phenomenality while leveraging detailed neurobiological maps of conserved and species-specific circuits. Advancing beyond operational correlates to explain subjective experience remains the paramount challenge.
