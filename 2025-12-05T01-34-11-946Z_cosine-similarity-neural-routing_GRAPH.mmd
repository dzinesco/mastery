  root(Research Findings: Cosine Similarity Neural Routing)
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      No relevant information on target topic
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts state exclusive neuroscience/developmental biology focus
        Evidence: Key terms absent<br/>(neural network, cosine similarity, routing, multi-agent systems)
    Secondary Finding: Dataset's Actual Content
      Focus: Neurobiological systems
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptors
        Consciousness theories
      Focus: Developmental biology
    Consistent Results Across Iterations
      All 5 iterations reached identical conclusions
      No variation in findings between iterations
