# Executive Summary: Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic literature and its influence on early Christian eschatology

Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic literature, composed between 200 BCE and 100 CE, provided the essential framework for early Christian eschatology. Key texts like 1 Enoch and Daniel established core features—a deterministic worldview, revealed heavenly secrets, and visions of the end times—which early Christians directly inherited. This tradition became central to New Testament theology, with Christianity preserving and reshaping these Jewish apocalyptic forms to express its own beliefs.

The transmission involved specific, influential motifs. Concepts of sudden divine intervention, a final judgment, the coming of a messianic "Son of Man," and the resurrection of the dead moved directly from Jewish texts into Christian writings. This is evident in the permeation of Daniel's language into the Gospels, the apocalyptic structure of John's Gospel, and Paul's revelation of divine "mysteries," demonstrating a deep conceptual and literary continuity.

A significant transition occurred after 135 CE, as rabbinic Judaism turned toward legal interpretation while Christianity further cultivated apocalypticism. Scholarly debate continues regarding the genre's origins, with influences from Persian thought and Canaanite mythology noted, but a primary debt to later Hebrew prophets like Ezekiel is emphasized. Future research could further clarify these historical influences and the precise mechanisms of theological adaptation within different early Christian communities.
