    Evidence from Iterations
      Iteration 1
        Explicit artifact statements
        High relevance scores (0.66-0.73) despite irrelevance
      Iteration 2
        Confirmed absence of key concepts
        No data on glutathione or lipid peroxidation pathways
    
    System Performance Issue
      Retrieval System Failure
        Fundamental query-source mismatch
        High scores for irrelevant content
        Potential systematic scoring error
    
    Conclusion
      No relevant data in provided sources
      Database may lack required domain content
