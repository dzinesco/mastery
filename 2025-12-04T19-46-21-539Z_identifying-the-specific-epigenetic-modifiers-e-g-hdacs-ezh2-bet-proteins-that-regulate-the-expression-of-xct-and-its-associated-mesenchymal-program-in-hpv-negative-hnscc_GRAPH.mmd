    Findings from Literature Search
      No Relevant Data in Provided Sources
        Dataset Content Mismatch
          Entirely Neuroscience & Developmental Biology
            Thalamocortical system
            Neuropeptide receptor expression
            Gene regulatory networks
            Theories of consciousness
        Absence of Oncology/Epigenetics Topics
          No ferroptosis data
          No viral infection data
          No epigenetic modification data
          No head and neck cancer data
          No cystine/glutamate transport data
      Explicit Confirmation of Irrelevance
        Artifacts state: "No relevant data exists"
        High semantic scores (0.70-0.76) reflect methodological language only
        No topical relevance to query
    Conclusion
      Dataset is entirely irrelevant to the requested research topic
      No information on HDACs, EZH2, or BET proteins regulating xCT
      Gap identified: No data from provided sources
