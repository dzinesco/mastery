  root((Neurobiological Constraints on Computational Models))
    
    Central Substrate: Thalamocortical System
      Role: State & Content of Consciousness
        State (Wakefulness/Thresholds)
          Matrix neurons
          Reticular Activating System (RAS)
        Content (Perceptual Constancy)
          Core neurons
          Corticothalamocortical loops
      Mechanism: Reciprocal Resonant Loops
        Thalamic gating & cortical feedback
        Gamma oscillations for active cognition
        Central topological role (relay/integrator)
      Key Component: Thalamic Reticular Nucleus (TRN)
        Regulates thalamic firing
        Induces local slow waves
        Critical for state transitions
    
    Dynamic Control: Neuromodulatory Systems
      Function: Network State Reconfiguration
        Regulate synaptic plasticity windows
        Enable flexible computational modes
        Act as non-local "third factor" learning signals
      Key Systems & Roles
        Acetylcholine (ACh)
          Enhances bottom-up precision
          Induces TRN burst firing (M2 receptors)
          Suppresses slow oscillations
        Dopamine
          Encodes reward prediction error
        Serotonin, Norepinephrine, etc.
          Modulate behavioral state transitions
      Mechanism: Connectome Modulation
        Project broadly to fixed structural connectome
        Enable "flip-flop" switches (e.g., sleep-wake)
        Create activity hyperchannels via weight modulation
    
    Integration Challenge for AI Architectures
      Constraint: Move Beyond Static Cortical Models
        Thalamic gating limits cortical plasticity effects
        Requires state-dependent gating & plasticity
      Opportunity: Bio-Inspired Algorithm Design
        Simulate thalamocortical & neuromodulatory loops
        Enable automatic novel task learning
        Increase network flexibility & capability
    
    Computational Modeling Approaches
      Bridging Scales: Cellular to Macroscale
        Biophysical models (e.g., receptor-specific effects)
        Link to system functions (e.g., inverted-U working memory)
      Tools & Frameworks
        Thalamoreticular microcircuit models
          Reproduce oscillations & physiological phenomena
          Openly available for disorder studies
        Dynamical Systems & Connectome Data
          Percolation renormalization group (PRG) methods
          Reveal phase transitions & critical dynamics
      Dominant Paradigm: Bayesian Brain
        Formalizes probability distributions & priors
        Faces conceptual implementation challenges
    
    Critical Gaps in Current Models
      Issue: Selective Biomimicry
        Focus on electrical signals, decouple multiscale effects
        Fail to capture neuromodulator diffusion & metabolic coupling
      Need: Integrative Multiscale Models
        Combine dynamics, neuromodulation, & connectomics
        Address rhetorical/conceptual slippage in frameworks
