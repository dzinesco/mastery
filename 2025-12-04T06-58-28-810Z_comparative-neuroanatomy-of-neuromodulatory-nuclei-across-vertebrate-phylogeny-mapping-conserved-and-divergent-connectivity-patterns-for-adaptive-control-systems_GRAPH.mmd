    Core Theme: Conserved & Divergent<br>Connectivity Patterns

    %% First Major Branch: Highly Conserved Core Circuits
    Highly Conserved Core Circuits
      Habenular Complex (Epithalamus)
        ::: conserved
        Present in all vertebrates
        Medial (MHb) & Lateral (LHb) divisions
        Core MHb → Interpeduncular Nucleus (IPN) circuit
          ::: highly_conserved
          Via fasciculus retroflexus
          Conserved from fish to mammals
        Serves as integrative hub
          Links cognitive/emotional networks to brainstem
      Locus Coeruleus (LC)
        ::: conserved
        Vertebrate-specific noradrenergic nucleus
        Conserved compact, pigmented architecture
        Widespread, collateralized projections
        Key hub in Reticular Activating System (RAS)
      Four Primary Ascending Neuromodulatory Systems
        ::: conserved
        Acetylcholine (ACh)
        Norepinephrine (NE) - LC
        Dopamine (DA)
        Serotonin (5-HT)
        Function: Regulate brain-wide states & behavioral transitions

    %% Second Major Branch: Phylogenetic Divergence & Specialization
    Phylogenetic Divergence & Specialization
      Habenular Evolution
        Asymmetry
          Pronounced in fish (sensory inputs)
          Reduced in amniotes (limbic inputs)
        LHb Connectivity
          More complex in tetrapods
          Integrates with basal ganglia & prefrontal cortex
      Forebrain & Thalamic Reorganization
        Thalamocortical Connectivity
          Limited in fish
          Substantial reciprocal links in amniotes
        Amygdala & Basal Forebrain
          Homologous structures exist across vertebrates
          Basal ganglia & extended amygdala are conserved
      Nucleus-Specific Variations
        Vestibular Efferent Nucleus
          Single cluster in non-mammals
          Multiple groups in mammals (e.g., group-e)
        Basal Ganglia Expansion
          Sequential components in historical models
          Mammals elaborated neocortex

    %% Third Major Branch: Conserved Integration Hubs
    Conserved Integration Hubs for Adaptive Control
      Periaqueductal Gray (PAG)
        Receives convergent higher-order inputs (e.g., VMH)
        Integrates amygdala, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex
        Regulates context-appropriate instinctive behaviors
      Reticular Activating System (RAS)
        Includes LC, Raphe, Reticular Formation
        Mediates arousal, consciousness, attention
      Basal Forebrain Cholinergic System
        Topographic projections to cortex/hippocampus
        Receives neuromodulatory inputs (VTA, DRN, LC)
        Regulated by local GABAergic inhibition

    %% Fourth Major Branch: Deep Phylogenetic Conservation
    Deep Phylogenetic Conservation
      Nitrergic System Architecture
        Conserved organizational pattern from bony fish to amniotes
      Core Vertebrate Brain Plan
        Conserved basal forebrain regions
        Conserved neuromodulatory systems for adaptive control
      Tetrapod Ancestor Circuitry
