  root(Consciousness Research Findings)
    (Core Consensus)
      Mathematical model for phenomenality remains elusive
        Evidence: Multiple artifacts explicitly state: "we do not have any theory that gives a mathematical model for subjectivity of consciousness."
    (Operational Definition)
      Defined via measurable correlates
        Uses analogy to systems theory
        Evidence: Described as "measurability criteria" parallel to "observability criteria in dynamic systems"
    (Scope of Existing Theories)
      Primarily model complexity, not subjective quality
        Evidence: Stated that theories "primarily model the complexity of consciousness, not its subjective quality."
    (Dominant Philosophical Framework)
      Functionalism
        Most influential for AI & machine consciousness
        Defines mental states by causal roles
        Analogy: Mind as computer software
    (Neurobiological Correlates)
      Thalamocortical system implicated
        Evidence: Identified as a "central neurobiological" structure related to consciousness
    (Note on Data Scope)
      Provided artifacts are about consciousness, not quantum computing history
        Evidence: No mention of "quantum computing" in any artifact content
