      Specific Topics
        "Thalamocortical system"
        "Neuropeptide receptors"
        "Consciousness theories"
        "Gene regulatory networks"
      "No computer science/cryptography content"
    Technical Term Analysis
      "Absent Terms"

      "No overlap with query domain"
    Relevance Score Anomaly
      "Scores range ~0.64-0.80"
      "Misleading metric"
        "Does not indicate topical relevance"
        "May reflect confidence in irrelevance assessment"
        "Possible pattern matching vs semantic alignment"
    Consistency Across Iterations
      "30 iterations show same result"
      "Unanimous agreement on irrelevance"
