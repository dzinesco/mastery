  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Complete Thematic Mismatch
        All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Zero overlap with machine learning
      Evidence: Specific Topics in Dataset
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
    Absence of Key Query Terms
      "Domain adaptation"
      "Optimal transport"
      "Label noise"
      "Distribution shift"
    Dataset Characteristics
      High Internal Consistency
        Uniform focus on neuroscience/biology
        Repeated confirmation across artifacts
      Relevance Score Pattern
        Scores range: 0.69 - 0.83
        Reflect semantic similarity, not topic relevance
        Indicate confidence in irrelevance assessment
    Implications
      Systematic Retrieval Mismatch
        Possibly mislabeled data
        Incorrect dataset matching
      No Information on Target Topic
        Cannot address adversarial domain adaptation
        No data on optimal transport under label noise
