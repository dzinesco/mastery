  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Complete absence of target topic content
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Evidence: No technical terms (ANN, HNSW, IVF, PQ, LSH, etc.)
      Uniform irrelevance across all sources
        Evidence: Consistent message in all artifacts
        Evidence: High relevance scores (0.64-0.80) despite mismatch
    Dataset Content Analysis
      Exclusive neuroscience/biology focus
        Thalamocortical system development
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
      No overlap with computer science domains
        No information retrieval concepts
        No machine learning vector search
        No database systems for vector search
    Search System Observations
      Misleading relevance scores
        Scores suggest partial relevance
        Actual content shows complete domain mismatch
        Potential scoring system flaw
      Consistent retrieval of irrelevant dataset
        Multiple query variations yield same results
        Includes related technical topics
    Secondary Observations
      Dataset also lacks related topics
        No embedding vector similarity metrics
        No quantum computing relevance (GKP codes mentioned but irrelevant)
      Artifact consistency
        Identical/similar content across artifacts
        Same conclusion repeated with different IDs
