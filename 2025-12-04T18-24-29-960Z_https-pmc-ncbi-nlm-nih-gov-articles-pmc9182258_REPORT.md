## Executive Summary

# Executive Summary: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9182258/

This research synthesizes key findings on the neurobiological and theoretical foundations of consciousness. A central conclusion is that while the thalamocortical system, operating via reciprocal resonant loops, is identified as the primary neurobiological substrate for conscious states and content, a mathematical model for the subjective, phenomenal aspect of consciousness (subjectivity) remains elusive. Current theories primarily model the complexity of consciousness rather than its intrinsic quality of experience. Consequently, the field relies on operational definitions using "measurability criteria" analogous to observability in dynamic systems to study consciousness empirically.

Important details reveal a multi-level framework. Four primary neuromodulatory systems—acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin—originate in subcortical regions and project broadly to regulate global brain states and flexible behavioral transitions. At a molecular level, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) determine the identity and connectivity of these neuromodulatory cells. Furthermore, neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems, such as neuropeptide receptor expression and the locus coeruleus, show evolutionary conservation across vertebrates with species-specific variations, highlighting both shared mechanisms and adaptive specializations in the neural architecture underlying consciousness.

Significant gaps persist, most notably the absence of a formal theory for subjectivity—the "hard problem" of consciousness. Current AI consciousness tests measure behavioral proxies and cognitive capabilities, not genuine sentience, underscoring this theoretical limitation. Future research must bridge this divide by developing mathematical frameworks for phenomenality while leveraging detailed neurobiological maps of conserved and species-specific circuits. Advancing beyond operational correlates to explain subjective experience remains the paramount challenge.

## Artifacts

### Artifact 1: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9182258/ - Iteration 1

- Consciousness is operationally defined through measurable correlates, but a mathematical model for its subjective aspect (phenomenal experience) remains elusive.
  Evidence: Multiple sources explicitly state 'we do not have any theory that gives a mathematical model for subjectivity of consciousness.' Available theories model the complexity of consciousness, not its subjective quality. Operational definitions rely on 'measurability criteria' analogous to observability criteria in dynamic systems.

- Four primary neuromodulatory systems (acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin) form the core ascending systems that regulate brain-wide states and flexible behavioral transitions.
  Evidence: Multiple sources identify these four molecules as the primary neuromodulatory systems originating in brainstem/midbrain/basal forebrain and projecting broadly to modulate synaptic transmission patterns and brain-wide activity. They are described as essential for regulating transitions between different behavioral and cognitive states.

- Neuropeptide receptor expression patterns show evolutionary conservation with species-specific variations in distribution.
  Evidence: Neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYR) genes show conserved brain expression across vertebrates (primates, rodents, fish), but with species- and region-specific patterns. NPY1R mRNA shows layer-specific cortical patterns that vary between cortical regions and species.

- Current AI consciousness testing focuses on behavioral proxies rather than direct evidence of phenomenal experience.
  Evidence: Multiple sources describe tests like the AI Consciousness Test (ACT), Maze Test, and behavior-based evaluations that measure consciousness-related behaviors (spatial awareness, perspective-taking, integrated information processing) but explicitly warn against conflating performance with genuine sentience. Researchers emphasize these tests measure cognitive capabilities, not subjective experience.

- A fundamental distinction exists between the complexity of consciousness and its subjective quality (subjectivity).
  Evidence: Sources consistently differentiate between theories that model the complexity or information integration aspects of consciousness and the core problem of explaining subjective, first-person experience. This distinction is central to the current theoretical landscape.

# Executive Summary: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9182258/

This research synthesizes key findings on the neurobiological and theoretical foundations of consciousness. A central conclusion is that while the thalamocortical system, operating via reciprocal resonant loops, is identified as the primary neurobiological substrate for conscious states and content, a mathematical model for the subjective, phenomenal aspect of consciousness (subjectivity) remains elusive. Current theories primarily model the complexity of consciousness rather than its intrinsic quality of experience. Consequently, the field relies on operational definitions using "measurability criteria" analogous to observability in dynamic systems to study consciousness empirically.

Important details reveal a multi-level framework. Four primary neuromodulatory systems—acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin—originate in subcortical regions and project broadly to regulate global brain states and flexible behavioral transitions. At a molecular level, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) determine the identity and connectivity of these neuromodulatory cells. Furthermore, neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems, such as neuropeptide receptor expression and the locus coeruleus, show evolutionary conservation across vertebrates with species-specific variations, highlighting both shared mechanisms and adaptive specializations in the neural architecture underlying consciousness.

Significant gaps persist, most notably the absence of a formal theory for subjectivity—the "hard problem" of consciousness. Current AI consciousness tests measure behavioral proxies and cognitive capabilities, not genuine sentience, underscoring this theoretical limitation. Future research must bridge this divide by developing mathematical frameworks for phenomenality while leveraging detailed neurobiological maps of conserved and species-specific circuits. Advancing beyond operational correlates to explain subjective experience remains the paramount challenge.
