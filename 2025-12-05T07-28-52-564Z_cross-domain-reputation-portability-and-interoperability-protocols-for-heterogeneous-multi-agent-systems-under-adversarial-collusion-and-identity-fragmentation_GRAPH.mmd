  root((Research Synthesis:<br/>Dataset Analysis))
    
    Primary Finding
      Complete Information Absence
        Zero relevant data in 50 artifacts
        All artifacts discuss unrelated domains
        Uniform irrelevance across all sources
    
    Evidence of Mismatch
      Domain Discrepancy
        Query Domain: Computer Science
          ::icon(fa fa-laptop-code)
          Multi-agent systems
          Reputation protocols
          Cybersecurity & trust
        Dataset Domain: Biological Sciences
          ::icon(fa fa-dna)
          Neuroscience
          Developmental biology
          Gene regulatory networks
      Terminological Gap
        Absent Query Terms
          Decentralized trust
          Reputation systems
          Cross-domain portability
          Interoperability protocols
          Adversarial collusion
          Identity fragmentation
        Present Dataset Terms
          Thalamocortical system
          Neuropeptide receptors
          Consciousness theories
          Gene regulatory networks
    
    Analysis Characteristics
      Consistency Across Iterations
        30 independent analyses
        Identical core findings
        High agreement (0.65-0.75 relevance scores)
      Scoring Pattern
        Scores reflect response structure
        Not content relevance
        Meta-analysis format similarity
    
    Conclusion
      Systematic Domain Mismatch
        Not partial coverage
        Fundamental data misalignment
        Irreparable for synthesis task
      Research Implication
        Dataset unusable for topic
        Need for correct domain sources
        Methodology validation required
