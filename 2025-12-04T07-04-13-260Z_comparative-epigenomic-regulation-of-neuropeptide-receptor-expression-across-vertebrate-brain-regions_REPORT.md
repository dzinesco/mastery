# Executive Summary: Comparative epigenomic regulation of neuropeptide receptor expression across vertebrate brain regions

This research synthesizes comparative findings on the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of neuropeptide receptor expression, focusing on Neuropeptide Y receptors (NPYRs) across vertebrate brains. Key insights reveal a core principle: while neuropeptide signaling pathways show deep evolutionary conservation in overall network architecture, the specific expression patterns of receptors exhibit significant species- and region-specific divergence. This divergence is functionally consequential, as evidenced by links between receptor expression in primate limbic regions and anxiety-related temperament.

Important details highlight conserved genomic and regulatory mechanisms underlying this variation. NPYR genes show widespread brain expression, but with precise patterns (e.g., cortical layer specificity) that differ between species. Evidence points to shared transcriptional regulation, potentially from overlapping gene structures, as seen in the coordinated expression of NPY1R and NPY5R in rats. Crucially, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) composed of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements are central to establishing neuromodulatory cell identity, providing a framework for both conservation and evolutionary diversification of receptor profiles.

Notable gaps include a limited understanding of the direct epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation) governing these expression patterns in a comparative context. Most evidence is correlational from mRNA studies, lacking functional validation of specific regulatory elements across species. Next steps require integrated multi-omics approaches—combining comparative epigenomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional genomics—to directly map the conserved and divergent regulatory logic controlling neuropeptide receptor expression and its impact on behavior across vertebrates.

## Artifacts

### Artifact 1: Comparative epigenomic regulation of neuropeptide receptor expression across vertebrate brain regions - Iteration 1

- Neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYR) genes show conserved expression in the brain across vertebrate species, but with species- and region-specific patterns.
  Evidence: Studies in primates, rodents, and fish (e.g., common carp, zebrafish) show NPYR genes are widely expressed in the brain. In primates and rodents, NPY1R mRNA is detectable across cortical fields with layer-specific patterns that vary between cortical regions and species. In fish, transcriptome data reveals NPY2R and NPY4R are highly expressed in the brain, with similar expression patterns observed between related species.

- There is evidence for co-expression and shared transcriptional regulation among NPY receptor subtypes, potentially due to genomic organization.
  Evidence: In the rat brain, the presence of Npy5r mRNA always corresponds with Npy1r mRNA, but not vice versa. This pattern may arise from overlapping gene structures on the chromosome and shared transcriptional control elements, as noted in primate studies.

- Expression of specific NPY receptors in limbic regions is linked to functional outcomes and shows species-specific regulatory patterns.
  Evidence: In the primate amygdala, lower mRNA levels of NPY1R and NPY5R in the central nucleus (Ce) predict elevated anxiety-like temperament (AT). Detailed in situ hybridization in rhesus amygdala shows distinct distributions for NPY1R and NPY5R mRNA across nuclei, with expression patterns not fully conserved in rodents.

- Comparative studies reveal both conservation and divergence in neuropeptide signaling pathways at the level of neuropeptide and receptor expression.
  Evidence: Research in C. elegans and related species shows neuropeptidergic signaling is remarkably divergent in neuropeptide and receptor expression, yet the overall network topology of the neuropeptidergic connectome remains stable. In zebrafish, comparative analysis with mice shows similarities in hypothalamic neuropeptide gene expression profiles but also species-specific patterns.

- Epigenomic and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a central role in determining neuromodulatory cell type identity, which may underlie conserved and divergent expression patterns.
  Evidence: GRNs composed of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements determine neuronal cell type identity, including neuromodulatory phenotypes, across species. Studies in zebrafish and C. elegans show distinct transcription factors can determine neuronal identity, suggesting a mechanism for evolutionary diversification of neuropeptide receptor expression.
