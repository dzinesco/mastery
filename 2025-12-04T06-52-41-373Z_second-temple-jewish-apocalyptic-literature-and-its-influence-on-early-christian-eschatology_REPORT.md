# Executive Summary: Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic literature and its influence on early Christian eschatology

Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic literature, composed between 200 BCE and 100 CE, provided the essential framework for early Christian eschatology. Key texts like 1 Enoch and Daniel established core features—a deterministic worldview, revealed heavenly secrets, and visions of the end times—which early Christians directly inherited. This tradition became central to New Testament theology, with Christianity preserving and reshaping these Jewish apocalyptic forms to express its own beliefs.

The transmission involved specific, influential motifs. Concepts of sudden divine intervention, a final judgment, the coming of a messianic "Son of Man," and the resurrection of the dead moved directly from Jewish texts into Christian writings. This is evident in the permeation of Daniel's language into the Gospels, the apocalyptic structure of John's Gospel, and Paul's revelation of divine "mysteries," demonstrating a deep conceptual and literary continuity.

A significant transition occurred after 135 CE, as rabbinic Judaism turned toward legal interpretation while Christianity further cultivated apocalypticism. Scholarly debate continues regarding the genre's origins, with influences from Persian thought and Canaanite mythology noted, but a primary debt to later Hebrew prophets like Ezekiel is emphasized. Future research could further clarify these historical influences and the precise mechanisms of theological adaptation within different early Christian communities.

## Artifacts

### Artifact 1: Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic literature and its influence on early Christian eschatology - Iteration 1

- Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic literature flourished between approximately 200 BCE and 100 CE, with key texts including 1 Enoch, Daniel, Jubilees, 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, and the Apocalypse of Abraham.
  Evidence: Sources identify this period as the primary timeframe for Jewish apocalyptic composition, listing representative texts and noting their non-canonical status in the Hebrew Bible but preservation through Christian translations.

- This literature is characterized by a deterministic worldview, revelation of heavenly secrets, visions of the eschatological future, and a dualistic cosmology often mediated by angelic beings.
  Evidence: Multiple sources describe common features: artificial time categories determined by God, revelation (apokálypsis) of hidden things, visions of the end times, and interactions with supernatural beings (e.g., the 'apocalyptic Moses' who ascends to heaven).

- Early Christianity directly inherited and adapted Jewish apocalyptic traditions, making apocalypticism a central component of early Christian theology and eschatology.
  Evidence: Sources state Christianity 'preserved the Jewish apocalyptic tradition and gave it a Christian character,' with the New Testament (e.g., Revelation, the 'Little Apocalypse' in the Gospels, Pauline epistles) reflecting the form and content of Jewish apocalyptic writings.

- Key apocalyptic motifs—including sudden divine intervention, final judgment, the coming of a messianic figure (Son of Man), and the resurrection of the dead—were transmitted from Jewish texts into early Christian thought.
  Evidence: Analyses note the permeation of language from Daniel into the Gospels, the apocalyptic framework of John's Gospel depicting Jesus's descent and ascent, and Pauline references to 'mysteries' now revealed (e.g., Col 1:26), all echoing Jewish apocalyptic themes.

- The transition from Jewish to Christian apocalypticism occurred as rabbinic Judaism turned toward legal interpretation after 135 CE, while Christianity cultivated the genre to express its own beliefs about Jesus and the end times.
  Evidence: Sources indicate that after Jewish revolts failed, rabbis moved away from apocalypticism, but Christians adopted and expanded it, using it as a 'vehicle for its own ideas' about Christ's second coming and final judgment.

- Scholars debate the origins of Jewish apocalyptic literature, with proposed influences including Canaanite mythology, Persian thought, and especially the later prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Ezekiel, Deutero-Isaiah).
  Evidence: Research mentions possible antecedents in Canaanite myths and Persian ideas, but emphasizes that the 'major source' is the prophetic literature of the Old Testament, where themes were adapted and expanded into a distinct genre.
