# Executive Summary: The reception and transformation of Enochic traditions (specifically the Book of Parables, 1 Enoch 37-71) in the Christology and eschatology of the Johannine literature and the Epistle to the Hebrews.

The Book of Parables (1 Enoch 37-71) provides a significant conceptual background for New Testament Christology and eschatology, particularly in the Johannine literature and the Epistle to the Hebrews. Its depiction of a pre-existent, heavenly "Son of Man" figure—enthroned, associated with divine Wisdom, and exercising final judgment—directly informed first-century messianic expectations. The New Testament authors transformed these Enochic traditions, integrating them into a distinctively Christian framework centered on Jesus.

In the Gospel of John, the Enochic Son of Man's pre-existence, descent/ascent motif, and revelatory-judicial function are adapted to portray Jesus as the descending and ascending Word. Hebrews, while less direct, shares a conceptual milieu, applying similar themes of pre-existence and heavenly exaltation to a unique high-priestly Christology using Melchizedek traditions. Critical scholarship notes this was not direct literary borrowing but a creative adaptation within a shared Second Temple Jewish thought world, as these texts were preserved and transmitted by later Christian communities.

Key limitations include the complex transmission history of 1 Enoch, the debated, potentially late identification of Enoch as the Son of Man (1 Enoch 71), and the absence of the Parables among the Dead Sea Scrolls, complicating claims of direct dependence. Next steps for research involve deeper comparative analysis of specific eschatological motifs (e.g., throne-room visions) and further investigation into the oral or intermediary channels through which these traditions circulated in early Christian circles.
