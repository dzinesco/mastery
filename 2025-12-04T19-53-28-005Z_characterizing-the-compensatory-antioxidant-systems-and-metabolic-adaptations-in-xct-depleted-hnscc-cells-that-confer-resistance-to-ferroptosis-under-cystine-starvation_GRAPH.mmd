  root(Research Findings Analysis)
    Primary Finding: Dataset-Topic Mismatch
      All 50 data artifacts are exclusively neuroscience/developmental biology
        Thalamocortical system
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
      Zero overlap with requested cancer biology/ferroptosis topic
    Specific Absences in Dataset (No Relevant Data)
      Core Topic Elements
        xCT (SLC7A11) & cystine uptake
        Glutathione metabolism & redox adaptation
        Ferroptosis resistance mechanisms
        Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
      Requested Mechanisms & Pathways
        Compensatory antioxidant systems
        Metabolic rewiring under cystine starvation
        Lipid peroxidation product signatures
        GPX4-independent resistance
        Upstream signaling (NRF2, ATF4, YAP/TAZ)
        Metabolic dependencies (glutamine, cystine)
      Specific HNSCC Contexts
        HPV-negative metabolic subtypes
        Mesenchymal HNSCC cells
        xCT-overexpressing phenotypes
    Evidence from Search Iterations
      Consistent result across 4 separate queries
      Multiple artifact IDs cite the mismatch
        (e.g., b986efe1..., baec0abc..., 429baed6...)
      Targeted searches for specific mechanisms returned null
        xCT-mediated cystine uptake in HNSCC
        Downstream transcriptional targets
        Metabolic rewiring & lipid peroxidation
        Redox adaptation mechanisms
    Conclusion
      Dataset is fundamentally misaligned
      No data exists to characterize the requested adaptations
