  root((Evolutionary Pressures on<br>Neuromodulatory Systems))
    Core Ascending Systems
      Four primary neuromodulators
        Acetylcholine
        Norepinephrine
        Dopamine
        Serotonin
      Origin: brainstem/midbrain/basal forebrain
      Function: regulate brain-wide states & flexible behavioral transitions
    Deep Phylogenetic Conservation
      Evolved from basic survival functions
        Food consumption
        Arousal to novelty/danger
      Conservation across animal phyla
        Cnidaria: dopamine controls mouth-opening
        Nematodes: dopamine modulates locomotion
        Vertebrates: conserved basal ganglia & dopamine functions
    Arousal Regulation
      Fundamental neuromodulatory function
      Primary mediator: noradrenaline (locus coeruleus)
      Contributing systems
        Cholinergic (basal forebrain)
        Serotonergic (raphe nucleus)
        Histaminergic
        Orexigenic
      Function: essential for sustained attention
    Emergent Internal States
      Properties across phyla
        Pleiotropy (affects multiple systems)
        Persistence
        Scalability
        Valence (positive/negative)
      Examples
        Fear
        Arousal
        Hunger
        Motivation
    Complex Regulatory Networks
      Systems influence each other
        Direct interactions
        Indirect regulation
      Examples
        Peri-locus coeruleus zone receives multiple inputs
        Dopamine neurons regulated by multiple neuromodulators
        Co-localization in neurons/regions
    Attention Mechanisms
      Two processing modes
        Bottom-up (stimulus-driven)
        Top-down (voluntary)
      Key modulator: arousal
        Fluctuates with interest/fear/surprise
        Affects signal-to-noise ratio
        Modulates information-processing ability
    Valence Mechanisms
      Evolutionary continuity
        Conserved dopamine role in reward learning
      Evidence across species
        Nematodes (C. elegans) to mammals
        Birds: dopamine reflects vocal prediction errors
        Vertebrates: similar value-based behaviors
    Affective Communication
      Cross-species perceptual continuity
        Humans read arousal in monkey vocalizations
        Continuity across mammalian vocal expressions
      Conserved mechanism
        Intrinsic pitch-arousal connection
        Maintained in mammalian vocal production
