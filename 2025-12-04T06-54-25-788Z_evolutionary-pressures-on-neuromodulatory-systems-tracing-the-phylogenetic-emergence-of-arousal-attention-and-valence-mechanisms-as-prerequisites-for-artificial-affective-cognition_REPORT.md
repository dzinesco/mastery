## Executive Summary

# Executive Summary: "Evolutionary pressures on neuromodulatory systems: tracing the phylogenetic emergence of arousal, attention, and valence mechanisms as prerequisites for artificial affective cognition"

This research synthesizes the evolutionary origins of core neuromodulatory systems as prerequisites for artificial affective cognition. Four primary systems—acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin—form phylogenetically conserved ascending networks that regulate brain-wide states and behavioral flexibility. These systems evolved from basic survival functions, such as food consumption and arousal to novelty, and demonstrate deep conservation across animal phyla, from cnidarians to mammals.

Key internal states like arousal, attention, and valence emerge from neuromodulatory regulation and share cross-species properties: pleiotropy, persistence, scalability, and valence. Arousal is fundamentally mediated by noradrenaline, with contributions from multiple systems, and serves as a critical modulator for sustained attention. Valence mechanisms show evolutionary continuity, with dopamine playing a conserved role in reward learning. Furthermore, complex regulatory networks exist where neuromodulatory systems interact directly and indirectly, enabling integrated control of behavioral states.

Current findings highlight conserved principles but also reveal gaps in understanding the precise computational interactions and emergent dynamics of these systems in artificial architectures. Limitations include the complexity of translating pleiotropic, persistent biological mechanisms into discrete artificial models. Next steps involve designing artificial affective systems that incorporate these evolutionary insights, focusing on scalable, integrated neuromodulatory-inspired architectures to enable adaptive, context-sensitive cognition.

## Artifacts

### Artifact 1: "Evolutionary pressures on neuromodulatory systems: tracing the phylogenetic emergence of arousal, attention, and valence mechanisms as prerequisites for artificial affective cognition" - Iteration 1

- Four primary neuromodulatory systems (acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin) form the core ascending systems that regulate brain-wide states and flexible behavioral transitions.
  Evidence: Multiple sources identify these four molecules as the primary neuromodulatory systems originating in brainstem/midbrain/basal forebrain and projecting broadly to modulate synaptic transmission patterns and brain-wide activity. They are described as essential for regulating transitions between distinct computational modes and brain states.

- Neuromodulatory systems evolved from basic functions related to survival (food consumption, arousal to novelty) and show deep phylogenetic conservation across animal phyla.
  Evidence: Dopamine signaling controls mouth-opening responses to food in Cnidaria (simplest nervous systems) and modulates locomotor activity in nematodes. Across vertebrates including bony fish and lampreys, basal ganglia structure and dopamine signaling support similar behaviors as in mammals. The evolutionary incentive to perceive novelty/danger leads to arousal responses conserved across species.

- Arousal regulation is a fundamental function of neuromodulatory systems, primarily mediated by noradrenaline from the locus coeruleus, with contributions from multiple systems.
  Evidence: Optimal physiological arousal is essential for sustained attention and is regulated by noradrenaline from the locus coeruleus. Multiple systems including cholinergic (basal forebrain), serotonergic (raphe nucleus), histaminergic, and orexigenic systems all contribute to regulating arousal levels through cortical activation.

- Internal states (arousal, attention, valence) emerge from neuromodulatory regulation and share core properties across animal phyla: pleiotropy, persistence, scalability, and valence.
  Evidence: Internal states like fear, arousal, hunger, and motivation are partially hidden variables that shape perception, cognition, and action. These states are characterized by properties including pleiotropy (affecting multiple systems), persistence, scalability, and valence (positive/negative), with research focusing on their neural basis across animal phyla.

- Neuromodulatory interactions create complex regulatory networks where systems influence each other both directly and indirectly.
  Evidence: The peri-locus coeruleus zone receives cholinergic, serotonergic, and adrenergic inputs representing points of indirect regulation. Dopamine neuron activity is regulated by neuromodulatory inputs including norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides. Multiple neuromodulators can be co-localized in single neurons or brain regions.

- Attention mechanisms depend on both bottom-up (stimulus-driven) and top-down (voluntary) processes regulated by neuromodulatory systems, with arousal as a key modulator.
  Evidence: Sustained attention involves both automatic bottom-up processing and voluntary top-down control. The arousal model modulates sustained attention through the locus coeruleus, affecting external signal-to-noise ratio and internal information-processing ability. Arousal levels fluctuate with interest, fear, or surprise and are essential for attention regulation.

- Valence mechanisms show evolutionary continuity with dopamine playing a conserved role in reward learning across species, from nematodes to mammals.
  Evidence: Dopamine function in learning and memory is conserved between C. elegans and mammals. In birds, dopamine reflects vocal performance prediction errors during birdsong practice. Across vertebrates, dopamine signaling supports similar value-based behaviors, suggesting deep phylogenetic roots for valence processing.

- Vocal expression of emotional arousal shows cross-species perceptual continuity, suggesting conserved neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying affective communication.
  Evidence: Humans can read emotional arousal in monkey vocalizations, and vocal expression of arousal shows continuity across mammalian species. While production mechanisms differ across phylogeny, the intrinsic connection between vocal pitch and arousal is maintained in mammalian vocal production systems.
