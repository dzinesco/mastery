  root(Research Findings Analysis)
    (Dataset Content Analysis)
      Exclusively Neuroscience & Developmental Biology
        Thalamocortical system studies
        Neuropeptide receptor expression
        Gene regulatory networks
        Theories of consciousness
      No Quantum Computing Content
        Zero mentions of "quantum computing"
        No entanglement distillation protocols
        No dynamic circuit cutting
        No distributed quantum computing
    (Topic Irrelevance Assessment)
      Complete Domain Mismatch
        Target: Quantum information science
        Actual: Consciousness research
        Target: Quantum optimization
        Actual: Biological systems modeling
      Consistent Irrelevance Pattern
        All 50 artifacts off-topic
        Relevance scores: 0.53-0.67
        Highest scores still neuroscience
        No cross-layer optimization data
    (Research Implications)
      Dataset Cannot Address Topic
        No evidence for optimization protocols
        No heterogeneous noise model data
        No latency constraint analysis
        New data source required
      Methodology Observation
        Clear topic boundary definition
        Effective irrelevance detection
        Need for domain-specific corpus
