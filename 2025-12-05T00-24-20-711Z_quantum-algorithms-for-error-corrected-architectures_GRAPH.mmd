  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    Dataset Content Discrepancy
      No relevant quantum computing information
        Evidence: 40 artifacts exclusively neuroscience/biology
        Term "quantum computing" absent entirely
      Complete focus on consciousness research
        Core consensus: No mathematical model for phenomenality
        Theories model complexity, not subjective quality
        Operational definitions use measurability criteria
    Neurobiological Substrates of Consciousness
      Thalamocortical system as central substrate
        Operates via reciprocal resonant loops
        Thalamus plays "central topological role"
      Specific thalamic neuron functions
        Core vs. matrix neuron types
        Differential regulation of content/state
    Philosophical Frameworks in Machine Consciousness
      Functionalism as most influential for AI
        Defines mental states by causal roles
        Mind as software analogy (machine functionalism)
        Underpins strong AI debates
      Other frameworks mentioned implicitly
        Contrasting views on computational cognition
