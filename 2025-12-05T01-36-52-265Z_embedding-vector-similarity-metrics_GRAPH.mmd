  root((Embedding Vector Similarity Metrics Research))
    Finding 1: Dataset contains no relevant information
      Evidence: All 40 artifacts discuss neuroscience topics
        Topics: thalamocortical system
        Topics: neuropeptide receptors
        Topics: consciousness theories
      Evidence: Absence of key terms
        Terms: embedding
        Terms: vector similarity
        Terms: cosine similarity
        Terms: Euclidean distance
    Finding 2: Dataset focused on unrelated domains
      Evidence: Exclusive neuroscience/biology focus
        Domain: neuroscience
        Domain: developmental biology
      Evidence: No overlap with computational topics
        Missing: machine learning
        Missing: vector similarity topics
      Evidence: Specific artifact confirmation

        ID: 785c7551-04a2-4210-91b3-35f17bb7cf61
    Finding 3: Related searches also yielded null results
      Evidence: Failed search attempts
        Query: neural network cosine similarity routing
        Query: prototype learning with softmax temperature
        Query: contrastive learning for task dispatch
      Evidence: Consistent absence of ML content
