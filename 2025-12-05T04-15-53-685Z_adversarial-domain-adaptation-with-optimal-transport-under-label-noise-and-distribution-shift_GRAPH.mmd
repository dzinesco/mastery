  root((Research Findings))
    Primary Finding: Dataset Irrelevance
      Complete Topic Mismatch
        Evidence: All 50 artifacts discuss neuroscience/biology
        Examples: Thalamocortical system, Neuropeptide receptors, Gene regulatory networks, Theories of consciousness
      Zero Overlap with Query Domain
        Query Domain: Machine Learning / Domain Adaptation
        Data Domain: Neuroscience / Developmental Biology
    Evidence: Absence of Key Terms
      Missing Core ML Terms
        "domain adaptation"
        "optimal transport"
        "label noise"
        "distribution shift"
        "adversarial"
        "Wasserstein"
      Uniform Absence Across All Sources
    Evidence: Consistency of Irrelevance
      High Internal Dataset Consistency
        All sources thematically aligned (neuroscience)
      Uniformly Low Relevance Scores
        Scores range: ~0.68 to ~0.79
        Indicates systematic, agreed-upon mismatch
    Conclusion: Systematic Mismatch
      No information on requested topic exists in dataset
      Dataset is homogeneous but irrelevant
