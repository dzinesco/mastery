# Executive Summary: BitNet breakthrough December 2025 leaked benchmarks

**Executive Summary**

Our research team conducted an investigation into the leaked benchmarks of BitNet's performance in December 2025. After reviewing five iterations, we found that no publicly available benchmarking results are available for this specific timeframe.

Despite extensive searches, we were unable to find any credible sources providing benchmarking results for BitNet's performance in December 2025. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the leaked benchmarks. Further investigation is needed to verify the accuracy of these claims.

The absence of publicly available benchmarking results creates a significant gap in our understanding of BitNet's capabilities during this time period. To move forward, we recommend exploring alternative sources and methods for verifying the performance of BitNet, as well as reiterating with stakeholders to confirm the availability of any leaked benchmarks.
