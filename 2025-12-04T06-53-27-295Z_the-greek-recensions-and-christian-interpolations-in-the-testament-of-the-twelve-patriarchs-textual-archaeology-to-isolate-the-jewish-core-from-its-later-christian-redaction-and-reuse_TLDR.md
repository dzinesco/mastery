# Executive Summary: The Greek recensions and Christian interpolations in the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs: textual archaeology to isolate the Jewish core from its later Christian redaction and reuse.

The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs is a complex pseudepigraphical text, preserved primarily in Greek manuscripts from the 10th century onward. Scholarly consensus, established over centuries, identifies it as a fundamentally Jewish work from the Second Temple period that was subsequently and extensively edited by Christian scribes. Its transmission history is typical of such texts, having been predominantly preserved by Christian communities, which embedded their own theological perspectives into the material.

Critical analysis relies on comparing multiple ancient versions—Greek, Armenian, and Slavonic—to detect later additions. The Armenian version, for instance, contains fewer overt Christian interpolations than the Greek. Specific Christian edits include prophecies about Jesus, references to baptism and crucifixion, and direct identifications of Jesus with God. Furthermore, the discovery of related Aramaic fragments among the Dead Sea Scrolls provides external evidence for an earlier, non-apocalyptic Jewish source, aiding the textual archaeology to separate core layers from redaction.

Despite agreement on the presence of Christian interpolations, significant debate continues regarding their precise extent and nature, with many proposed identifications remaining contested. The primary limitation is the lack of complete early manuscripts, requiring reliance on comparative textual criticism. Next steps for research involve deeper synthesis of evidence from the Qumran fragments with the later versions to more precisely reconstruct the hypothesized Jewish core and understand the theological motives behind its Christian reuse.
