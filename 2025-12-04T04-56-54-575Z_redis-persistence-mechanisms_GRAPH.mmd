This mindmap diagram illustrates the relationships between Redis persistence mechanisms, trade-offs, and intervals. It shows how RDB and AOF persistence methods interact with each other and their respective trade-offs.

**Key points:**

*   **RDB**: Creates point-in-time copies of the dataset at specified intervals.
*   **AOF**: Logs every write operation in an append-only manner to the end of an AOF file.
*   **Trade-Offs**: Both RDB and AOF have trade-offs between performance, durability, and recovery speed.

**Subgraphs:**

*   **Trade-Offs**: Highlights the trade-offs associated with each persistence method.
    *   **Performance Impact**: The impact on performance when using RDB or AOF.
    *   **Durability and Consistency**: The level of durability and consistency provided by each method.
    *   **Recovery Time**: The time required to recover data in case of a failure.
*   **RDB Intervals**: Shows the intervals at which RDB snapshots are created, including custom intervals.
*   **AOF File**: Illustrates the structure of an AOF file, including write operations and file contents.
