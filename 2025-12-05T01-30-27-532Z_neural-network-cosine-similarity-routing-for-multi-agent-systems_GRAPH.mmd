  root((Research Findings Analysis))
    primary_finding: Dataset Irrelevance to Query
      key_evidence: Explicit statements in artifacts
        "Dataset discusses topics exclusively in neuroscience and developmental biology"
        "Terms 'neural network', 'cosine similarity', 'routing', 'multi-agent systems' absent"
      consistent_result_across_iterations
        All 50 artifacts confirm irrelevance
        Pattern holds for related computational queries
    actual_dataset_focus: Neurobiology & Consciousness
      central_theme: Thalamocortical System
        Proposed as substrate for consciousness
        Operates via reciprocal, resonant loops
        Thalamus has "central topological role"
      sub_theme: Neural Circuit Evolution
        Conservation of core architectures
          e.g., habenular nuclei circuits
        Species-specific variation in fine structure
      sub_theme: Neuropeptide Receptor Expression
        Evolutionary conservation (NPYR genes)
        Species- and region-specific patterns
      sub_theme: Mathematical Modeling of Consciousness
        Challenge: No model for subjective experience
        "We do not have any theory that gives a mathematical model for subjectivity of consciousness"
        Operational definitions rely on measurability criteria
    key_implication: Domain Mismatch
      query_domain: Computational AI / Multi-agent Systems
      dataset_domain: Biological Neuroscience
      no_overlap: No artifacts address routing algorithms or cosine similarity
