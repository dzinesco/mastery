    Consciousness Research Consensus
      Core Challenge: Modeling Subjectivity
        "No mathematical model for phenomenality"
        Available theories model complexity only
        Subjective quality remains elusive
      Operational Definitions
        Measurable correlates of consciousness
        Analogous to dynamic systems observability
        Criteria-based consciousness assessment
      Theoretical Frameworks
        Complexity-based consciousness models
        Neurobiological correlates
        Developmental perspectives
