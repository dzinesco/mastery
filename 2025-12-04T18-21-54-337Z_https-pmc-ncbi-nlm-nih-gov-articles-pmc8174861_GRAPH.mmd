    %% Central Theoretical Challenge
    Theoretical & Definitional Framework
      Mathematical Model for Subjectivity Remains Elusive
        ::icon(fa fa-question-circle)
        Evidence: Explicit statement that no theory provides a mathematical model for subjectivity
        Available theories model complexity, not phenomenal quality
      Operational Definition via Measurable Correlates
        ::icon(fa fa-ruler)
        Evidence: Relies on 'measurability criteria' analogous to observability in dynamic systems
        Allows empirical study despite the hard problem
    
    %% Core Neurobiological Substrates
    Neurobiological Substrates of Consciousness
      Central Role of Thalamocortical System
        ::icon(fa fa-brain)
        Evidence: Thalamus has a "central topological role"
        Operates via reciprocal corticothalamocortical loops
        Core vs. matrix thalamic neurons regulate content (e.g., perceptual constancy) and state
      Critical Neuromodulatory Systems (ACh, NE, DA, 5-HT)
        ::icon(fa fa-sliders-h)
        Evidence: Originate in brainstem/midbrain/basal forebrain
        Project broadly to modulate synaptic transmission & global brain states
        Enable flexible transitions (e.g., sleep-wake) via "flip-flop" switch models
      Specific Regulatory Nuclei & Circuits
        Thalamic Reticular Nucleus (TRN)
          Regulates thalamocortical dynamics; ACh induces burst firing
        Locus Coeruleus (LC)
          Vertebrate-specific noradrenergic hub with conserved, widespread projections
    
    %% Evolutionary & Developmental Perspectives
    Evolutionary & Developmental Conservation
      Conserved Core Circuit Motifs & Architectures
        ::icon(fa fa-project-diagram)
        Evidence: Highly conserved circuits (e.g., habenula-interpeduncular) across vertebrates
        Basic cell types and areal organization show conservation
      Species-Specific Divergence in Fine Details
        ::icon(fa fa-code-branch)
        Evidence: Specific connectivity patterns and receptor distributions vary
        Example: Neuropeptide Y receptor expression shows conserved patterns with regional variations
      Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) Determine Cell Identity
        ::icon(fa fa-dna)
        Evidence: Transcription factors (e.g., Etv4) govern neuromodulatory cell development
        Central to evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo)
    
    %% AI & Machine Consciousness
    AI & Machine Consciousness
      Dominant Philosophical Framework: Functionalism
        ::icon(fa fa-laptop-code)
        Evidence: Defines mental states by causal roles; underpins strong AI arguments
        Mind as software (machine functionalism)
      Current Testing Focuses on Behavioral Proxies
        ::icon(fa fa-robot)
        Evidence: Tests (ACT, Maze Test) measure capabilities (spatial awareness, integration)
        Explicit warning against conflating performance with sentience
        Measures cognitive capability, not subjective experience
    
    %% Key Relationships (as cross-links in notes)
    Notes on Key Relationships
      ::icon(fa fa-link)
      Neuromodulators dynamically regulate the fixed thalamocortical structural connectome.
      Evolutionary conservation provides a comparative basis for identifying essential circuits.
      The gap between behavioral proxies (AI tests) and phenomenal experience mirrors the core theoretical challenge.
      GRNs provide the developmental basis for the conserved neuromodulatory systems.
