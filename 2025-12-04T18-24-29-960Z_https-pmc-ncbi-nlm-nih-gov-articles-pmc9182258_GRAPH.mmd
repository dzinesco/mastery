    %% Central Theoretical Challenge
    1_Elusive_Mathematical_Model
      :::highlight
      No mathematical model for subjectivity
      :::
      Theories model complexity, not phenomenality
      Operational definitions via "measurability criteria"
      (Analogous to observability in dynamic systems)

    %% Core Neurobiological Substrate
    2_Central_Neurobiological_Substrate
      Thalamocortical System
        Thalamus: "central topological role"
        Operates via reciprocal, resonant loops
        Core vs. matrix neuron types
        Regulates both state and content of consciousness

    %% State Regulation Systems
    3_Neuromodulatory_Systems
      Four Primary Ascending Systems
        Acetylcholine
        Norepinephrine
        Dopamine
        Serotonin
      Origin: brainstem/midbrain/basal forebrain
      Function: Regulate global brain states
      Enable flexible behavioral transitions
      "Flip-flop" switch models (e.g., sleep-wake)

    %% Evolutionary & Molecular Foundations
    4_Evolutionary_&_Molecular_Basis
      Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs)
        Determine neuromodulatory cell identity
        Govern connectivity (e.g., via transcription factors like Etv4)
      Conserved Neural Circuits
        Locus Coeruleus (vertebrate-specific, conserved architecture)
        Habenula-IPN pathway (highly conserved)
      Neuropeptide Systems (e.g., NPY Receptors)
        Evolutionary conservation across vertebrates
        Species- & region-specific expression patterns

    %% Applied Domains & Testing
    5_Applied_Research_&_Testing
      Machine Consciousness & AI
        Dominant framework: Functionalism
        AI Consciousness Tests (ACT, Maze Test)
        Focus: Behavioral proxies, not direct evidence of sentience
        Warning: Conflating performance with genuine experience
      Fundamental Distinction
        Complexity/Information theories vs. Subjective quality theories
        The "hard problem" remains central
