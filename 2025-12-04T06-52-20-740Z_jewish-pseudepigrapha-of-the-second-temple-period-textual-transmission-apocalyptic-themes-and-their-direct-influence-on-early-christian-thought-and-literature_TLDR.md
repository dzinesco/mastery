# Executive Summary: Jewish pseudepigrapha of the Second Temple period: textual transmission, apocalyptic themes, and their direct influence on early Christian thought and literature

This research synthesizes findings on Jewish pseudepigrapha from the Second Temple period, highlighting their complex transmission and significant influence. A key insight is that these texts, though of Jewish origin, were almost exclusively preserved by Christian communities, with their survival dependent on later Christian manuscripts. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls provided crucial, contemporary manuscript evidence, confirming the antiquity and authenticity of works like 1 Enoch and Jubilees. Furthermore, these pseudepigrapha, encompassing diverse genres such as apocalypses and testaments, directly shaped foundational concepts in early Christian thought.

The textual journey of these works is multilingual, typically originating in Hebrew or Aramaic, translating into Greek, and later into languages like Ethiopic and Slavonic. Their apocalyptic themes—including cosmic judgment, the "Son of Man," and messianic expectations—provided a conceptual framework adopted by early Christian authors. Determining the original Jewish provenance of these texts, however, is complicated by centuries of Christian transmission and potential redaction, requiring scholarly methods to disentangle authentic layers from later adaptations.

Major gaps in understanding stem from the fragmentary nature of the manuscript record and the challenges of textual criticism in distinguishing Jewish origins from Christian interpolations. Next steps for research involve continued comparative analysis of the Qumran evidence with later Christian versions to better trace textual evolution and more precisely map the direct lines of influence from specific pseudepigraphic themes to the composition of the New Testament and other early Christian literature.
